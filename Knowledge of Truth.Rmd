## **The Danger of False Teachers and Heretical Preaching**

The Bible warns of **false teachers and preachers** who spread **heresies** and lead people astray. These individuals distort the Word of God for their own gain, manipulating scriptures to deceive others. In **2 Peter 2:1-3**, it says: “But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord who bought them—bringing swift destruction on themselves. Many will follow their depraved conduct and will bring the way of truth into disrepute. In their greed these teachers will exploit you with fabricated stories.”

The Bible further warns in **1 Timothy 4:1-2**: “The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons. Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron.” These teachers preach not the truth of Christ but the **lies of the enemy**, leading many away from sound doctrine.

Additionally, **Matthew 24:24** says, “For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect.” This scripture highlights that **even the elect** may fall into the trap of these false teachers if they are not vigilant.

### **The Misunderstanding of the Word of God**

There is a **widespread misunderstanding** when it comes to the word of God. Many people have misinterpreted His word and resorted to practices that are not in line with what God intended. One of the most common misconceptions is that the **Old Testament's physical rituals**, such as animal sacrifices and breaking altars, should be carried out in the modern age. These practices, while important in their time, were merely **symbolic** of the spiritual life that was to come through Jesus Christ.

### **The Fulfillment of the Law Through Christ**

Jesus Himself made it clear that He did not come to abolish the law of Moses, but to **fulfill** it (**Matthew 5:17**). The laws and practices in the Old Testament were meant to point us to Christ, the One who would fulfill all the righteous requirements. As the prophet **Jeremiah foretold**, God would no longer write His laws on tablets of stone but would write them on our hearts (**Jeremiah 31:33**). The Old Testament practices were simply **symbols** of the spiritual transformation that was to come through Christ.

The Apostle Paul elaborates on this in **Romans 8:3-4**: “For what the law was powerless to do because it was weakened by the flesh, God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh to be a sin offering. And so he condemned sin in the flesh, in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fully met in us, who do not live according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.” Paul points out that the law, despite being holy and righteous, was powerless to save us because it could not address the sinful nature of humanity. However, **Christ, by His sacrifice, fulfilled what the law could not do** and made it possible for us to be made righteous through Him.

In **Romans 10:4**, Paul writes: “Christ is the culmination of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes.” Here, Paul emphasizes that the law was always leading us to Christ, and through Him, we find righteousness, not by adhering to the law but through **faith in Him**.

Paul further states in **Galatians 3:24-25**: “So the law was our guardian until Christ came that we might be justified by faith. Now that this faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian.” The law served as a temporary measure, a guide that pointed to the ultimate solution in Christ. With His coming, we are no longer bound by the law, but are justified by **faith** in Him.

### **Abraham's Test and God's Provision**

When God tested Abraham’s faith by asking him to sacrifice his son Isaac, God provided a **substitute** in the form of a ram (**Genesis 22:13**). This ram symbolized **Jesus Christ**, who would one day lay down His life for the sins of the world. The **substitutionary atonement of Christ** is the ultimate fulfillment of the Old Testament sacrificial system. If we believe in Christ and accept Him as our Savior, we are assured of **redemption** through His death and resurrection.

## **Rejecting Modern Misconceptions of Spiritual Warfare**

In recent times, many so-called **men of God**, who once started with **genuine faith** and obedience to **God's Word**, have fallen into **deception**. Many of them have entered ministry **not as a calling**, but as **a business**, driven by the desire for **wealth, fame, and personal gain**. In their quest to build **large followings**, they often **twist the message of the gospel**, leading people into **deception**. Paul warns against those who view godliness as a means of **financial profit** (1 Timothy 6:5). One of the common false teachings is that in order to "**break evil altars**" or gain **spiritual victory**, believers must give a **specified amount of money**. This is not only a **distortion of the gospel** but a **tactic straight from the enemy**, the god of this world (2 Corinthians 4:4).

Others, initially led by the **Spirit of God**, have become ensnared by the **pleasures of this world** — their **greed for wealth** and **fame** driving them further from the truth (1 John 2:16; Matthew 6:24). As they chase after **worldly success**, their focus shifts from serving **God** to serving their **own desires**, allowing their ministries to become platforms for **personal gain** rather than places of **true spiritual growth** and **salvation** (2 Peter 2:3).

There are also those who began with a **humble heart** and a **genuine desire** to serve **God** but, over time, were overtaken by the **pride of life** (James 4:6; Proverbs 16:18). The pursuit of **power**, **recognition**, and **control** opened the door of their hearts to **evil spirits**, leading them astray. These individuals often lose sight of their **original calling** and allow their ministries to become **self-serving** rather than **Christ-centered**.

In all these cases, the **enemy** has successfully twisted their hearts and minds, using their desire for **personal gain**, **pride**, or **worldly pleasure** to lead them away from the truth. The scriptures say that '**the enemy masquerades as an angel of light**, and his servants do the same' (2 Corinthians 11:14-15). This is a **dangerous deception** that seeks to deceive the flock and distract them from the **genuine, transformative power of the gospel**. It is vital for believers to stay **rooted in the truth of God's Word** and to discern the difference between **true servants of Christ** and those who have allowed themselves to be used for the enemy's purposes.

## **The Deception of Transactional Faith: From Ministers to Diviners**

Many so-called **men of God** and **false prophets** have turned into **diviners**, performing **rituals** and selling items such as **holy waters**, **brooms**, and **handkerchiefs** to their followers. Some have been led to believe that they can **bribe God** or manipulate Him into removing their problems or delivering them from familiar spirits by paying a certain amount of money. This is a **gross distortion of the gospel**. **You cannot purchase God’s favor**, nor can you **pay Him to solve your problems**. The truth is that we must **first come to know God through Christ**. It is through a **relationship with Jesus** that we gain access to the **power of God**, not through **ritualistic payments**. When you **know God** and **trust in Him alone**, everything else becomes small in comparison, for you will be empowered to overcome any spiritual battle.

### **The Heart of True Worship**

Once we have recognized God’s power through Christ and trusted Him alone, we are called to offer our thanks to God with a heart full of gratitude. This offering should come from a place of love and devotion, not as a means of negotiating with God. For everything belongs to Him; He needs nothing from us. Psalm 50:10-12 reminds us that God owns the cattle on a thousand hills and does not need anything from us. If He needed anything, He would say it. Our offerings are meant to express our love for God, not to make transactions or manipulate Him. 

God does not need our sacrifices or offerings. He desires our hearts. As the prophet Samuel said, *“Does the LORD delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as in obeying the LORD? To obey is better than sacrifice...”* (1 Samuel 15:22). Many people today are trying to bribe God with sacrifices, but God will not accept the sacrifice if it is not offered with a pure heart. God does not look at the outward appearance but at the condition of the heart (1 Samuel 16:7).

### **True Spiritual Warfare**

According to 2 Corinthians 10:4, “The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world. On the contrary, they have divine power to demolish strongholds.” Spiritual warfare is not about physical rituals, sacrifices, or giving money to break curses. Our true battle is not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms (Ephesians 6:12). These physical acts, like animal sacrifices or specified monetary offerings to "break altars," have no place in the life of a believer in Christ. We are called to fight with the weapons of prayer, faith, and the Word of God.

---

### **The Danger of Deception**

The enemy has deceived many into thinking that these physical rituals are necessary for spiritual victory. Sadly, many believers unknowingly follow these false practices, believing that they are fulfilling God’s will. These misleading teachings have infiltrated the church, and it is vital for believers to return to the truth of God’s Word. Jesus Christ is the fulfillment of the law, and through Him, we have access to the power to break all strongholds (Matthew 11:28-30). If you are caught in these practices, it’s time to reevaluate your faith and actions, align them with Christ, and reject any teachings that distort the truth of the gospel.

---

### **The Role of Prayer**

The Bible teaches us that prayer is our most powerful weapon to demolish strongholds and overcome spiritual darkness. James 5:16 reminds us that "The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective." It is through prayer and the Word of God that we fight in the spiritual realms, not through physical rituals. True spiritual warfare involves using the authority given to us through Christ to destroy evil altars, break generational curses, and overcome all spiritual forces of darkness. 

Through prayer, believers in Christ have the authority to uproot, destroy, and demolish all evil altars in their families and lives. These altars, which represent the influence of sin and the enemy's hold on families, can be broken through fervent prayer in the name of Jesus. It is important to note that money or animal sacrifices should never be used to break altars. Instead, they should be used as expressions of gratitude in the form of offerings and tithes to God.

### **The Power of the Holy Spirit**

Living a victorious Christian life is not about performing rituals but allowing the Holy Spirit to guide and empower us. God desires our hearts and minds, and when we allow the Holy Spirit to control our lives, He will enable us to fulfill God’s will and live in victory. Romans 8:11 teaches that "If the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies because of His Spirit who lives in you."

---

### **The Power of Believers Through Christ**

Jesus made it clear that those who believe in Him will have the power to perform signs and wonders. He promised that believers would have authority over the enemy and that they would trample on snakes and scorpions, symbolizing victory over witchcraft and spiritual attacks (Luke 10:19). It is important to recognize that all power and authority are given to those who believe in Christ.

## **The Root of Evil in Our Hearts**

In the story of Cain and Abel, we see that Cain was rejected by God first before his offering was rejected. The reason for this rejection was the condition of his heart. In Genesis 4:6-7, God warns Cain, saying:

“Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast? If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin/evil is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must rule over it.”

Here, God clearly pointed out that Cain had the power to control the evil that was at the door of his heart. The evil that eventually led him to murder his brother was already lurking within him, but he still had a choice to overcome it. Cain's rejection was not because of his offering alone, but because of the state of his heart.

In contrast, Abel was accepted by God because his heart was in the right place, and God accepted both him and his offering. This illustrates an important truth: God accepts the person first, before accepting their offering. Our relationship with God and our heart's condition are far more important than the physical act of offering.

In Matthew 5:23-24, Jesus emphasizes this truth:

“Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother or sister has something against you, leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to them; then come and offer your gift.”

Jesus teaches that before presenting our offerings to God, we should first work on our salvation and reconcile with others. Our hearts must be right with God and with others. Without a heart of repentance and reconciliation, our offerings are not pleasing to God. It is the condition of the heart that matters most to God—He desires a broken and contrite heart (Psalm 51:17), not merely an outward act of worship.

### **The Struggle with Evil**:

The apostle Paul echoes this struggle when he writes in Romans 7:19, *“For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do—this I keep on doing.”* This highlights the internal conflict that every believer faces—our flesh desires to do evil, but through Christ, we are empowered to overcome it. It is the evil that resides in us that causes us to do the things we hate, and without Christ, we cannot control it.

### **The Need for Christ**:

A person who is not in Christ is vulnerable to evil spirits. When someone backslides, the Bible warns that seven more evil spirits come and dwell within them (Matthew 12:43-45). This shows the importance of staying grounded in Christ, for only He can protect us from the influence of evil spirits and give us the power to overcome the temptations and desires of our flesh. Without the Holy Spirit we cannot do the will of God.

## **Our Lives Written in His Book**

Our lives are written in God’s book, as stated in **Psalm 139:16**:

> _“Your eyes saw my unformed body; all the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be.”_

This truth applies to those who are **in Christ** and living under the will of God. The days of our lives are not left to chance but are divinely ordained, and these days will unfold according to God's plan for us. To **live in Christ** is to live in alignment with God’s will, which brings us into the fullness of purpose and blessing He has prepared for us.

The **Book of Life** contains the names of those who belong to Christ, as mentioned in **Revelation 20:15**:

> _“Anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire.”_

Therefore, **living in Christ** is essential to walking in the path God has set for us. If we choose to live according to the world, or follow our own sinful desires, we not only veer away from the purpose and plan God has ordained but also expose ourselves to **danger**. Living outside God’s will leaves us vulnerable to the power of death.

As **Job 36:14** warns:

> _“They die in their youth, among the male prostitutes of the shrines.”_

This implies that those living outside of God's protection are **exposed to premature death**, as they are not under His guarding presence. The power of death is against them, and when it comes upon them, they cannot escape. But for those who are **in Christ**, they are **protected and guarded by the angels of God** (**Psalm 91:11**), who watch over their lives. God's protection keeps them from harm, and they are shielded from the power of death that seeks to steal, kill, and destroy.

## **Christ’s Open Arms and the Gift of New Life**

One of the most powerful truths in the Bible is that Jesus Christ is waiting for everyone, regardless of their sins, religion or situations, with open arms. He is always ready to forgive, to cleanse, and to give a new life to anyone who calls upon His name. In Revelation 3:20, Christ says, *“Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with that person, and they with me.”* Jesus is always ready to embrace us and offer us the forgiveness and transformation we need, no matter what we have done in our past.

As believers, we must **actively choose** to live according to the **Word of God**, not by worldly standards or the desires of our sinful nature. **Christ offers us a new life**, one that is abundant and free from the power of sin. In **John 10:10**, Jesus promises:

> _“The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.”_

**Living in Christ** requires a **daily commitment** to study His Word and pray without ceasing (**1 Thessalonians 5:17**). **Praise and worship** are vital parts of this daily walk, for they draw us closer to God, align our hearts with His will, and empower us to overcome the challenges of life. By **abiding in Him**, we allow Him to transform our hearts, thoughts, and desires to reflect His purpose for us.

To **live in Christ** is to **surrender our will to His** and pursue His kingdom above all else (**Matthew 6:33**). As we do so, we find our lives aligning with the divine plan that was written for us before time began. **Only then** can we walk in the fullness of the purpose God has for us.
