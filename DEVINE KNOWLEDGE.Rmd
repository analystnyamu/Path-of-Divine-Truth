## Anointed but in Danger: Why Your Prophetic Gift Must Be Fully Surrendered to God

To all who are reading this, I speak to you with deep love, compassion, and a sense of urgency. The gift you carry is far more than a simple talent or ability‚Äîit is a **divine calling**, a spiritual treasure that has been placed within you by **God Himself**. Whether you recognize it fully or not, this gift is **powerful**‚Äîso powerful that it directly impacts the **spiritual realm** and can shake the foundations of the kingdom of darkness.

Your gift, whether it is prophetic, healing, leadership, or discernment, holds the potential to transform lives, to bring **freedom**, **hope**, and **healing**. But here lies the critical truth: **unless you fully surrender this gift to Jesus Christ**, it remains vulnerable. **Without total submission to Him**, this powerful gift can be hijacked, misused, and even distorted by the enemy.

The enemy knows the **power** of your gift. He has witnessed how those who walk in the fullness of their calling can bring about **divine change**‚Äîso he will do everything in his power to **steal**, **twist**, or **distract** you from walking in God‚Äôs plan. If your gift is not surrendered, it can become a tool in the hands of the enemy, leading you into confusion, frustration, and even deception.

This is why surrendering your gift to God is not a choice‚Äîit is a **necessity**. Only when you submit your gift to **Christ alone** can you be certain that it will fulfill its true purpose: to **glorify God** and advance His kingdom.

- **Scripture Reference**: *‚ÄúFor the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.‚Äù* ‚Äî **Romans 11:29**
  
Until you **fully surrender** this gift, it remains vulnerable to the schemes of the enemy. But when you give it completely to Christ, you will see it **flourish** in ways that are beyond your understanding and beyond your own strength.

### üö® The Enemy's Tactics: Distracting You From Who You Are

The enemy knows your destiny. He has been studying it since the moment you were conceived. He understands that the moment you fully embrace the **calling of God** on your life, your spiritual gifts will break chains, deliver souls, heal the brokenhearted, and transform lives. This is why he works tirelessly to **distract**, **confuse**, and **delay** you. Through rejection, pain, disappointment, and confusion, he aims to keep you from walking in the fullness of your calling and discovering the true power of the gift that God has placed within you.

The enemy‚Äôs most deceptive tactic is to lead those with spiritual gifts away from their true purpose by enticing them into false spiritual practices. These practices may appear harmless, and even offer temporary comfort or answers, but they are nothing but **traps of darkness**, designed to pull you further from God‚Äôs truth. These are **counterfeit paths**, leading to destruction.
    
- **Example 1: The Girl with the Spirit of Divination**
    In **Acts 16:16-18**, we encounter a girl who was possessed by a **spirit of divination**. She followed Paul and his companions, crying out, "These men are servants of the Most High God." On the surface, her words appeared true‚Äîshe was speaking accurate facts. However, the spirit behind her words was not the Holy Spirit; it was a **demonic spirit**. The enemy, though unable to create gifts of his own, twists and perverts God-given gifts to serve his own agenda. The girl‚Äôs prophetic gift was a counterfeit, a distortion of the true prophetic anointing, designed to deceive and mislead those around her. Though the words were technically correct, the source was wrong.
When Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, discerned the counterfeit, he cast the spirit of divination out of her. This moment revealed the truth: her ability, which had been misused and distorted, was not a genuine gift from God, but rather a counterfeit manifestation, twisted by the enemy to deceive and lead others astray.
This serves as a powerful reminder that while the enemy cannot create spiritual gifts, he can twist, counterfeit, and misuse them to cause confusion, division, and deception. What may seem like a gift could actually be a tool of manipulation and spiritual destruction when it's not aligned with God‚Äôs will.

    - **Scripture Reference**: *‚ÄúFor false christs and false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect.‚Äù* ‚Äî **Matthew 24:24**
    
    The enemy can twist prophetic gifts, leading those with true anointings to speak from spirits of confusion or deceit. This is why it is so vital to be fully **surrendered to Christ**‚Äîso that **His Spirit** will be the one guiding and speaking through you, and not the counterfeit spirits of the enemy.

- **Example 2: King Saul Consulting the Witch of Endor**  
    In **1 Samuel 28**, King Saul, in a time of desperation, sought out the **Witch of Endor** to summon the spirit of Samuel, even though God had strictly forbidden such practices. Saul, once a mighty king, was now lost and confused, desperate for direction. By turning to occult practices for answers, he opened himself to demonic influence and rejection from God. This story illustrates how easy it is for the enemy to use spiritual gifts for manipulation, even when the person is unaware. **When we turn to false sources for answers**, we, like Saul, may find ourselves caught in a trap that leads us further from God‚Äôs will.

    - **Scripture Reference**: *‚ÄúThere shall not be found among you... a medium or a spiritist or one who calls up the dead. For all who do these things are an abomination to the Lord.‚Äù* ‚Äî **Deuteronomy 18:10-12**

- **The Deceptive Allure of False Spiritual Practices**  
    Turning to **witch doctors**, **traditional seers**, or any source other than Christ for spiritual guidance is opening yourself to **demonic agreements**. Whether knowingly or unknowingly, each visit, each ritual, each offering you make‚Äîbe it an animal sacrifice, a charm, or a ritual‚Äîis a **spiritual transaction** that gives demons **legal access** to your life and destiny. These practices may feel like they offer temporary solutions or a sense of control, but they are only **spiritual traps** designed to bind you further.

    - **Scripture Reference**: *‚ÄúWhen you enter the land the Lord your God is giving you, do not learn to imitate the detestable ways of the nations there. Let no one be found among you who sacrifices their son or daughter in the fire, who practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft, or casts spells, or who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead.‚Äù* ‚Äî **Deuteronomy 18:9-12**

    - **Scripture Reference**: *‚ÄúFor it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.‚Äù* ‚Äî **Hebrews 10:4**  
    - **Scripture Reference**: *‚ÄúChrist, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.‚Äù* ‚Äî **1 Corinthians 5:7**  

    **Jesus Christ** is the **only acceptable sacrifice** before God. His blood is the **only thing** that has the power to cleanse you, redeem you, and set you free from the grip of darkness. Anything else‚Äîwhether it's an altar, a charm, or a sacrifice‚Äîis a **counterfeit** that cannot bring true freedom or salvation. 

    - **Scripture Reference**: *‚ÄúI am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.‚Äù* ‚Äî **John 14:6**

**How the Enemy Uses False Spiritual Practices to Mislead You**  
The enemy uses these counterfeit practices to confuse you and keep you in a state of spiritual **bondage**. He wants to keep you from walking in the **freedom** and **authority** that Christ offers. This is why it's so important to examine the sources of spiritual guidance in your life‚Äîwhether they are from God or from counterfeit spirits. Even a seemingly harmless encounter with a diviner or traditional healer can open doors to spiritual oppression and hinder your ability to walk in the **fullness of God‚Äôs plan** for your life.

- **Scripture Reference**: *‚ÄúDo not give the devil a foothold.‚Äù* ‚Äî **Ephesians 4:27**

In order to walk in the fullness of your prophetic calling, you must first renounce and reject all forms of false spiritual influence. This means cutting ties with any **demonic covenants** made through occult practices, ancestral rituals, or seeking answers from any source other than God. Only when you surrender your heart completely to God can He purify your gift and ensure that it operates according to His will.

- **Scripture Reference**: *‚ÄúSubmit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.‚Äù* ‚Äî **James 4:7**

#### Note

The enemy is desperate to distract, deceive, and distort the calling of God in your life. But you have a **divine purpose** that is much greater than anything he can offer. **Reject false sources of guidance**, **surrender your heart fully to Christ**, and allow **God's Spirit** to guide and refine your gifts. The **truth will set you free**‚Äîand when you are fully aligned with God's will, there is no power that can stop you from walking in the fullness of your calling.

- **Scripture Reference**: *‚ÄúYou will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.‚Äù* ‚Äî **John 8:32**
  
God has anointed you with a powerful gift that can change the world, but you must be willing to let Him refine it, purify it, and use it for His **glory** alone.

### üî• Repentance and Deliverance: The Path to Freedom

If you feel lost, confused, or unfulfilled, know that there is **hope** for you. **Repentance** and **deliverance** are the divine keys to your freedom and restoration. The weight of any past choices, any bondages, and all spiritual darkness can be broken through the power of Christ. It is time to **renounce** every **covenant** made with darkness and **step into the fullness** of the calling God has for you. 

To truly walk in the power of your prophetic gift, you must take these critical steps:

1. **Repent Deeply**  
   Repentance is a turning away from sin and a turning toward God. It‚Äôs not just about feeling sorry; it‚Äôs about deep sorrow for the things that have separated you from God. **Confess every act of rebellion, every act of disobedience**, and every **sin**‚Äîwhether known or unknown. Repent for every visit to witch doctors, all involvement in occult practices, every spiritual sacrifice made out of desperation, and every other way you have sought answers outside of Christ. Repentance opens the door for God's forgiveness and sets you free from the power of sin and darkness.

   - **Scripture Reference**: *‚ÄúRepent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near.‚Äù* ‚Äî **Matthew 4:17**  
   - **Scripture Reference**: *‚ÄúIf we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.‚Äù* ‚Äî **1 John 1:9**

2. **Renounce Every Covenant with Darkness**  
   The enemy has no legal right to hold you in bondage once you are **covered by the blood of Jesus**. You must **renounce** any covenant, agreement, or relationship you have made‚Äîknowingly or unknowingly‚Äîwith evil spirits. Every moment spent seeking guidance from occult practices, consulting traditional healers, or turning to false sources must be severed. **Declare with boldness** that you belong to Christ alone. **The blood of Jesus** is more than enough to break every chain and release you from every evil agreement.

   - **Scripture Reference**: *‚ÄúFor you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body.‚Äù* ‚Äî **1 Corinthians 6:20**  
   - **Scripture Reference**: *‚ÄúChrist redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us.‚Äù* ‚Äî **Galatians 3:13**

3. **Reject All False Sources**  
   It is essential to stop consulting, relying on, or seeking guidance from sources that are not of Christ. **Traditional seers**, **false prophets**, and any spiritual practices that lead you away from God‚Äôs Word are false sources of truth. They promise answers, but they only lead you into spiritual bondage. **God‚Äôs Word** is your only true source of wisdom, knowledge, and direction. In Him alone will you find peace, healing, and purpose.

   - **Scripture Reference**: *‚ÄúThere shall not be found among you anyone... who practices divination or sorcery... For all who do these things are an abomination to the Lord.‚Äù* ‚Äî **Deuteronomy 18:10-12**  
   - **Scripture Reference**: *‚ÄúYour word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.‚Äù* ‚Äî **Psalm 119:105**

4. **Surrender Your Gift to God**  
   Your gift‚Äîwhether prophetic, healing, or another divine anointing‚Äîis a precious treasure, but it is not meant to be used for personal gain or glory. **Surrender your gift completely to God**. Ask Him to purify your anointing and realign it with His will. When you give God full access to your gifts, He can use them to bring healing, deliverance, and transformation. **Submit your gift to Him, and watch Him move in power through you.**

   - **Scripture Reference**: *‚ÄúFor the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.‚Äù* ‚Äî **Romans 11:29**  
   - **Scripture Reference**: *‚ÄúI beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.‚Äù* ‚Äî **Romans 12:1**

5. **Seek Divine Direction**  
   The journey does not end with repentance and renouncement. **You need guidance**, and it‚Äôs crucial to connect with someone spiritually mature and filled with the Holy Spirit who can disciple you, pray with you, and help you walk in the fullness of your prophetic gift. Seek counsel from Godly mentors who can direct you to align your purpose with God‚Äôs will, help you grow spiritually, and ensure your gift is used for His glory.

   - **Scripture Reference**: *‚ÄúWhere there is no guidance, a people falls, but in an abundance of counselors, there is safety.‚Äù* ‚Äî **Proverbs 11:14**  
   - **Scripture Reference**: *‚ÄúTrust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make straight your paths.‚Äù* ‚Äî **Proverbs 3:5-6**

### ‚öîÔ∏è Like Balaam: Your Gift Can Be Used by God or by the Enemy

Your gift is precious, powerful, and divinely given, but it is important to understand that, like **Balaam** in the Bible, your gift can be **misused** or **misdirected** if your heart is not fully aligned with God's purposes. Even the most profound prophetic anointing can be corrupted when the heart is driven by **selfish desires** rather than a surrendered will to God.

#### **Example**: *Balaam, the Prophet Who Sold Out*

Balaam was a man who possessed a true prophetic gift‚Äî**a genuine ability to hear and speak on behalf of God**. Yet, despite his gift, Balaam was swayed by greed, pride, and a lack of love for God's people. King Balak of Moab hired Balaam to curse Israel, but God had already declared that Israel was blessed (Numbers 22-24). Instead of using his gift to serve God's will, Balaam chose to listen to his own desires, seeking rewards and recognition. This prideful desire for personal gain, coupled with his **lack of love for God's people**, led him down a dangerous path.

**Balaam‚Äôs heart** was not fully surrendered to God, and this led to his prophetic anointing being misused for the enemy‚Äôs purposes. Balaam was willing to use his prophetic gift for selfish reasons and to oppose God‚Äôs will. This story serves as a **powerful warning**: even a true prophetic gift can be **hijacked by the enemy** if not fully submitted to God.

- **Scripture Reference**: *‚ÄúBalaam loved the wages of unrighteousness‚Ä¶‚Äù* ‚Äî **2 Peter 2:15**

- **Scripture Reference**: *‚ÄúBut he was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man‚Äôs voice forbad the madness of the prophet.‚Äù* ‚Äî **2 Peter 2:16**

#### The Enemy‚Äôs Tactics: Hijacking Your Gift for Divination

The enemy's goal is to **hijack** your gift and use it for his own purposes. He desires to turn your **prophetic gift** into a tool of **divination**‚Äîthe very opposite of what God intended for you. **Divination** is the practice of seeking supernatural knowledge or power through **unholy means**, and it is rooted in the occult. When your heart is misaligned with God‚Äôs will, the enemy can take your genuine prophetic gift and **twist it** into divination.

In the same way Balaam‚Äôs prophetic gift was corrupted, the enemy can turn your prophetic insight into **false prophecy** or **divination** if you give into **pride**, **greed**, or a lack of love. The moment your heart is **not motivated by love** for God's people and a desire to glorify Him, you are at risk of using your gift for **selfish ambition** or even to manipulate others. A true prophet should never seek to **curse**, but to bless and speak life (Jeremiah 29:11). Yet Balaam's desire to please King Balak led him to attempt to curse Israel, despite God‚Äôs clear blessing over them. His gift was used for destruction, not deliverance.

- **Scripture Reference**: *‚ÄúFor the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.‚Äù* ‚Äî **Romans 11:29**  
- **Scripture Reference**: *‚ÄúBut if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast and be false to the truth. This is not the wisdom that comes down from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic.‚Äù* ‚Äî **James 3:14-15**

#### **Divination vs. Prophecy: A Call for Purity**

A prophetic gift is meant to **reveal** God‚Äôs heart and His will, leading to healing, deliverance, and transformation. **Divination**, on the other hand, seeks to gain hidden knowledge for personal gain or power, often through **spiritual manipulation**. While **prophecy** points to God‚Äôs truth and serves His Kingdom, **divination** is rooted in **darkness**, offering counterfeit revelations that are often aimed at controlling or manipulating others.

If your heart is not in full alignment with God‚Äôs will, the enemy can cause your prophetic gift to be **distorted** into a form of divination. This distortion can look like spiritual practices that seem harmless but are actually driven by a **self-serving** or **dark** agenda. Even though your words may seem accurate, the source behind them is not the Holy Spirit but a **demonic spirit** masquerading as the voice of God.

- **Scripture Reference**: *‚ÄúFor the Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He has anointed me to preach the good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free.‚Äù* ‚Äî **Luke 4:18** (A true prophet‚Äôs mission is liberation, not destruction.)

- **Scripture Reference**: *‚ÄúYou shall not learn to imitate the abominations of those nations. There shall not be found among you anyone who burns his son or his daughter as an offering, anyone who practices divination or tells fortunes or interprets omens, or a sorcerer‚Ä¶‚Äù* ‚Äî **Deuteronomy 18:9-12**

#### Darkness Attracts Darkness‚ÄîBut the Spirit of God Calls You Higher

When your gift is not surrendered to God, **darkness attracts darkness**. The enemy will try to twist your gift, pulling you further into spiritual deception and confusion. This is why it‚Äôs so important to guard your heart and align your life with God‚Äôs Word and will.

But **the Spirit of God** is calling you to rise above the darkness. **God‚Äôs voice** calls you higher, to use your gift for **His glory** alone. When you walk in complete surrender, your gift will be **pure**, a powerful tool for the Kingdom of God. Your gift will no longer be a tool for manipulation, self-interest, or destruction. Instead, it will be a vessel of **life**, bringing healing, deliverance, and transformation to those around you.

- **Scripture Reference**: *‚ÄúFor God is not a God of confusion but of peace.‚Äù* ‚Äî **1 Corinthians 14:33**  
- **Scripture Reference**: *‚ÄúI will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; I will counsel you with my eye upon you.‚Äù* ‚Äî **Psalm 32:8**

#### The Call to Alignment: Surrender Your Gift to God

As someone with a prophetic gift, you have a unique responsibility: **to fully surrender your gift** to God. Like Balaam, you can either use your gift to serve your own interests or you can choose to use it for God‚Äôs glory. But remember, the only way to be truly effective in the Kingdom of God is to **align your heart** with His will. 

When you do this, your gift will be **pure**, and it will be used to **build up the Body of Christ** and fulfill God‚Äôs purpose in the earth. Your gift will no longer be a tool for manipulation, self-interest, or destruction. Instead, it will be a vessel of **life**, bringing healing, deliverance, and transformation to those around you.

- **Scripture Reference**: *‚ÄúBut if anyone has this world's goods, and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how does God‚Äôs love abide in him?‚Äù* ‚Äî **1 John 3:17**  
- **Scripture Reference**: *‚ÄúHe must increase, but I must decrease.‚Äù* ‚Äî **John 3:30**

### üí° What Must You Do Now?

If you are reading this, it is not by accident. God is calling you to walk in **freedom**, and that journey begins with **total surrender**. It‚Äôs time to break free from every spiritual chain and step into the fullness of your destiny:

1. **Cry out to Jesus** ‚Äì Open your heart and ask Jesus to deliver you from every form of bondage. **Ask Him to purify your heart**, cleanse your spirit, and restore the gift He has given you. Surrender every part of your life to Him, acknowledging His Lordship over all.

2. **Destroy every evil altar** ‚Äì If you have any items, tokens, or connections linked to witchcraft, the occult, or false spiritual practices, **destroy them**. Whether it's charms, amulets, or any object that holds spiritual significance to evil, throw them away. These objects are **spiritual chains** holding you captive, and their destruction is essential to your deliverance.

3. **Refuse to curse** ‚Äì When faced with rejection, pain, or confusion, **ask the Holy Spirit** to guard your tongue. In those moments, choose to speak life over your situation, not curses. **Speak blessings, not bitterness**. **God's Word** has the power to heal and transform; let it be what flows from your mouth.

4. **Clothe yourself with humility and love** ‚Äì **Humility** is one of the most powerful spiritual weapons you can possess. **Pride** leads to destruction, but **humility** opens divine doors. Choose love over hate, forgiveness over bitterness, and grace over judgment. These are the qualities that reflect Christ‚Äôs nature and empower you to walk in your prophetic calling.

- **Scripture Reference**: *‚ÄúClothe yourselves, all of you, with humility toward one another, for God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.‚Äù* ‚Äî **1 Peter 5:5**

---

### üìñ Study the Word of God Every Day

To truly walk in your prophetic calling, you must **study the Word of God** daily. The **Bible** is not just a book‚Äî**it is the living Word of God**. It is your **spiritual manual**, guiding you in understanding your gift, its purpose, and how to use it for His glory. The more you immerse yourself in Scripture, the more you will receive **divine wisdom** and **understanding**, enabling you to navigate the complexities of the prophetic realm with clarity and truth.

**The Word of God** is **powerful** and **life-changing**. It is described as a **hammer** that breaks the hardest of hearts, a **double-edged sword** that divides soul and spirit, and a **lamp to our feet** that illuminates our path in darkness. **The Word of God** has the ability to **transform**, **sharpen**, and **renew** you. It is the **sword of the Spirit** (Ephesians 6:17), the **weapon** you need to defeat every lie of the enemy. **It is Christ Himself**, for the Bible says in John 1:1, *‚ÄúIn the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.‚Äù*

The Word of God is **alive and active**, speaking to you through its pages. As you study it daily, it becomes **a part of you**‚Äîshaping your thoughts, renewing your mind, and refining your heart. Like a tree planted by streams of water, you will **flourish** and **bear fruit** in every season (Psalm 1:3). You will become rooted and grounded in the truth, able to discern the voice of God from all others.

- **Example**: *King Saul Consults the Witch of Endor*  

The Word of God is **indispensable** in your walk with God. It strengthens you, purifies you, and helps you remain faithful to the path He has set before you. Without it, you risk being led astray, just like Saul. With it, you will walk confidently in your prophetic calling, empowered to speak God's truth and fulfill His purpose for your life.

- **Scripture Reference**: *‚ÄúIs not my word like fire, declares the Lord, and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?‚Äù* ‚Äî **Jeremiah 23:29**

Let the Word of God be the **foundation** of your prophetic ministry. Meditate on it day and night, and you will be like **a tree planted by streams of water**, bearing fruit in due season, and your **leaf will not wither** (Psalm 1:3). With the Word of God as your guide, you will be **empowered** to walk in **freedom** and **truth**.

### üíñ Deliverance and Surrender Lead to Freedom

Sin‚Äîwhether it's **sexual sin**, **blood sacrifices**, or any other past transgressions‚Äîcan open doors for **spiritual oppression**. These sins invite **evil spirits** into your soul and spirit, clouding your prophetic vision, and confusing the very gift God has placed within you. Until you experience true **deliverance**, these spirits will continue to torment you, leading you farther away from your divine purpose and spiritual destiny.

One of the most deceptive tactics of the enemy is through **false prophets**, **diviners**, **witch doctors**, or **traditional seers**. If you have opened doors to sin, particularly sexual sin, you may find that these spirits will demand **sexual intercourse** as a supposed means of cleansing or removing the unclean spirits from your life. These individuals may claim that **sex** is the solution to your spiritual problems, offering it as a ritual or "cleansing" process. But **this is a lie** from the enemy. The enemy wants to steal from you‚Äînot only your dignity but your **calling**, your **purity**, and your **prophetic gift**.

**The enemy uses this lie** to manipulate and lead you into deeper **spiritual bondage**, using your body as a vessel for evil spirits. These false promises are a tactic to **corrupt** your spirit, leading you farther into darkness. However, there is good news: when you fully surrender to Christ and seek **deliverance**, you will **break every chain** holding you back. You will be **free** from these demonic influences and free to walk in the **freedom and authority** God has given you.

**The power of the Holy Spirit** will fill you, enabling you to overcome every temptation, every lie, and every spiritual attack. Once you are delivered, the enemy will no longer have a foothold in your life. **Your prophetic gift** will be restored to its true purpose and aligned with God's will. You will no longer be a tool for evil, but a vessel for **God‚Äôs glory**, walking in the fullness of your divine calling.

- **Scripture Reference**: *‚ÄúWhere the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.‚Äù* ‚Äî **2 Corinthians 3:17**

When you surrender your life completely to Jesus, **your gift will be purified**, and you will be empowered to walk in your true calling, unshackled by the past. No longer will you be under the enemy‚Äôs influence; instead, you will shine as a **light** for God‚Äôs glory, free to use your prophetic gift for His kingdom.

---

### üíñ Final Word

You were **not born to be a victim of darkness**‚Äîyou were **born to tear down the works of darkness** through the **prophetic voice** that God has placed within you. It is time for you to **rise up** and step into the fullness of your calling. 

**Total surrender**, **obedience**, and **love** are the keys that unlock the true potential of your gift. When you choose to **fully surrender your life** and **prophetic calling to God**, you will walk in **freedom** and experience the **fullness of His power**. Your **obedience to God** will break every chain of oppression and align you with His divine purpose.

- **Scripture Reference**: *‚ÄúYou are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for His own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.‚Äù* ‚Äî **1 Peter 2:9**

The **darkness has no claim** on you. You are **called to bring light** into the world. When you surrender fully to God, you will not only walk in His light but **reflect His glory** wherever you go. God has chosen you to carry His anointing, and with His **guidance**, you will walk in the **authority and power** that He has destined for you. 

Unfortunately, the enemy has **deceived many** through **false prophets**, **diviners**, and **teachers** who **manipulate** and **exploit** those with devine gifts for selfish gain. Many of these **false leaders** often operate in **immorality**, having multiple wives or engaging in **sexual relations** with their **clients** or followers. These practices are **demonic**, and they serve as a means for these leaders to **further enslave** those seeking spiritual guidance. **Sexual exploitation** is a tool the enemy uses to keep people bound, defiled, and spiritually weak. 

But **God's way** is different. His way is one of purity, holiness, and righteousness. A true prophetic calling will always be accompanied by the **fruit of the Spirit**‚Äîlove, peace, joy, self-control, and godliness. 

The **enemy seeks to exploit and corrupt** your gift, but God is calling you to **step into your true identity** as His chosen vessel. **Surrender** to Him completely, and He will **restore** your gift to its original purpose‚Äî**for His glory**. Your prophetic voice will bring **healing, deliverance, and freedom** to others, not because of your own strength, but because of God's **power working through you**.

---

### The Path Forward:

1. **Reject Immorality** ‚Äì Do not allow your gift to be exploited or tainted by the ways of the world. The enemy wants to pull you into corruption, but **God's call** is one of holiness.

2. **Pursue Righteousness** ‚Äì **Walk in integrity**. Choose purity and holiness over the counterfeit promises of the enemy. Seek to glorify God in everything, including your prophetic calling.

3. **Seek Deliverance** ‚Äì If you have been manipulated, deceived, or abused by false leaders, **seek deliverance**. God offers freedom, and you can break every chain that has been placed on you.

4. **Walk in Freedom** ‚Äì The enemy no longer has control over your life. Walk in the authority that God has given you, knowing that **He has equipped you** to be a vessel of His light in a dark world.

- **Scripture Reference**: *‚ÄúThe Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The Lord is the stronghold of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?‚Äù* ‚Äî **Psalm 27:1**

Your **prophetic gift** was given to you by God, and it is meant to be used for His **kingdom**. **Surrender it to Him fully**, and watch as He uses you to bring transformation and hope to a broken world. With God, **nothing is impossible**, and you will walk in the **fullness of His purpose** for your life.

### Final Reminder:

**You are chosen, empowered, and equipped by God**. No matter what the enemy has tried to do, you are **protected**, **redeemed**, and **restored**. **Step into your calling**, and let your prophetic gift shine, not for your own glory, but for **God‚Äôs kingdom and His glory**.

- **Scripture Reference**: *‚ÄúThe gifts and calling of God are irrevocable.‚Äù* ‚Äî **Romans 11:29**
