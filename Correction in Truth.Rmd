## My Dear Sister, You Have a Great Gift—But It Must Be Surrendered to God Alone

To all who are reading this, I speak to you with love, understanding, and urgency. The gift you carry is not just a talent; it is a **divine calling**. The prophetic anointing that God has placed upon your life is powerful—so powerful that it poses a direct threat to the kingdom of darkness. However, unless you fully surrender your gift to **Jesus Christ**, it remains vulnerable to the **enemy's schemes**. 

### 🚨 The Enemy's Tactics: Distracting You From Who You Are

The enemy knows your destiny. He’s been studying it since you were a child. He understands that when you fully walk in the Spirit of God, many will be **delivered, saved, and transformed** through your words. That’s why the enemy has tried to **distract, confuse**, and **delay** you. He’s used rejection, pain, disappointment, and confusion to keep you from walking in the fullness of your calling.

One of the enemy’s most deceptive tactics is to pull those with **spiritual gifts** into false spiritual practices—things that appear to offer answers but are, in reality, **traps of darkness**. These practices might look harmless, even helpful, but they lead you down a dangerous path.

- **Scripture Reference**: *“There shall not be found among you... a medium or a spiritist or one who calls up the dead. For all who do these things are an abomination to the Lord.”* — **Deuteronomy 18:10–12**

When you turn to **witch doctors**, **traditional seers**, or seek spiritual guidance from sources other than Christ, you are **entering into agreements** with demonic powers, knowingly or unknowingly. Every sacrifice made, every ritual performed—whether it be a goat, sheep, or chicken—is a **spiritual transaction** that opens the door for demons to gain legal access to your life.

- **Scripture Reference**: *“For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.”* — **Hebrews 10:4**  
- **Scripture Reference**: *“Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.”* — **1 Corinthians 5:7**

### 🔥 Repentance and Deliverance: The Path to Freedom

You may feel lost, confused, or unfulfilled, but there is **hope**. **Repentance** and **deliverance** are the keys to your freedom. It is time to break every **covenant** made with darkness. To truly walk in the fullness of your prophetic gift, you must:

1. **Repent deeply** – Confess every act of rebellion. Repent for every visit to a witch doctor, every spiritual sacrifice, and every sin you have committed knowingly or unknowingly. 

2. **Renounce every covenant** – Break any agreement made with evil spirits, through the **blood of Jesus**. Declare boldly that you belong to Christ alone and reject every spiritual connection to darkness.

3. **Reject all false sources** – Stop consulting or seeking answers from traditional seers, false prophets, or any practices that lead you away from Christ. **God’s Word** is your only source of truth.

4. **Surrender your gift** – Your gift is a precious treasure, but it is not yours to use for your own glory. **Give it to God** completely. Ask Him to purify your prophetic anointing and align it with His will.

5. **Seek divine direction** – Ask God to lead you to someone spiritually mature, someone who is filled with the Holy Spirit, to disciple you and help guide you in using your gift for His glory.

- **Scripture Reference**: *“Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.”* — **James 4:7**  
- **Scripture Reference**: *“If the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.”* — **John 8:36**

### ⚔️ Like Balaam: Your Gift Can Be Used by God or by the Enemy

Your gift is precious and powerful, but like **Balaam** of the Bible, it can be swayed if your heart is not aligned with God’s purposes. Balaam had a genuine prophetic gift, but his love for personal gain led him astray.

- **Scripture Reference**: *“Balaam loved the wages of unrighteousness…”* — **2 Peter 2:15**

The enemy’s goal is to **hijack** your gift for his purposes. He wants to make you a tool of **divination**, not prophecy. If you don’t align yourself with God, you will still speak **accurately**, but from a polluted source. **Darkness attracts darkness**, but **the Spirit of God is calling you higher**.

### 💡 What Must You Do Now?

If you are reading this, it is not by accident. God is calling you to walk in **freedom**, and it starts with **total surrender**:

1. **Cry out to Jesus** – Ask Him to deliver you from every bondage, to purify your heart, and to restore your gift.

2. **Destroy every evil altar** – If you have charms, tokens, or anything linked to witchcraft or false spiritual practices, **destroy them**. Throw them away. These are **spiritual chains** holding you back.

3. **Refuse to curse** – In moments of rejection, hurt, or confusion, ask the Holy Spirit to guard your tongue. Speak life, not curses.

4. **Clothe yourself with humility and love** – These are your spiritual weapons. **Pride** leads to destruction, but **humility** opens divine doors.

- **Scripture Reference**: *“Clothe yourselves, all of you, with humility toward one another, for God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.”* — **1 Peter 5:5**

### 📖 Study the Word of God Every Day

If you have a prophetic gift, you must **study** the **Word of God** daily. The Bible is your **manual** for understanding your gift and how to use it. The more you study, the more **divine wisdom** and **understanding** you will receive, which will guide you in using your gift for God’s glory.

- **Scripture Reference**: *“Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.”* — **Psalm 119:105**

### 💖 Deliverance and Surrender Lead to Freedom

Sexual sin, blood sacrifices, or any sin of the past may have allowed spirits to be deposited in your soul and spirit. Until you are **delivered**, these spirits will remain and **confuse** you, even though you have a powerful gift. The enemy will use these spirits to steal your destiny.

But when you surrender **fully to Christ**, when you ask for **deliverance**, you will **break every chain**. When you are delivered and fully **surrender** your life to Jesus, you will receive the **power of the Holy Spirit**. The Spirit will give you access to the **power of God**, and the enemy will no longer have a chance to confuse you.

- **Scripture Reference**: *“Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.”* — **2 Corinthians 3:17**

Once you are delivered, your gift will be used **for God’s glory**, and you will walk in the **fullness of your purpose**.

### 💖 Final Word

You were not born to be a victim of darkness—you were born to **tear down the works of darkness** through the **prophetic voice** God has placed in you. **Total surrender**, **obedience**, and **love** are the keys that unlock the true potential of your gift.

- **Scripture Reference**: *“You are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, His own special people, that you may proclaim the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.”* — **1 Peter 2:9**

The enemy fears what you’ll become when you **fully surrender to Christ**. Don’t let confusion or delay steal your destiny. **This is your moment**—run to Jesus. He will make all things new, and your prophetic voice will be used to **advance His Kingdom**.

- **Scripture Reference**: *“For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.”* — **Romans 11:29**

This is your time. Embrace God’s plan for your life. You were born for greatness. Step into it, with Jesus as your Guide.
