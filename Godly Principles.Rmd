# RIGHT DECISIONS FOR A NEW YEAR: Walking in Godly Principles When Temptation Comes

# RIGHT DECISIONS FOR A NEW YEAR

# RIGHT DECISIONS FOR A NEW YEAR

## Walking in Godly Principles When Temptation Comes

> **Key Scripture:**
> *“Choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve.”* — **Joshua 24:15**

---

## INTRODUCTION: A YEAR IS BUILT BY DECISIONS

A new year is more than a change on the calendar—it is a **fresh opportunity to choose wisely**. While dates change automatically, **direction changes intentionally**. Nothing truly changes in life until decisions change.

Life does not move forward by intentions alone; it moves forward by **decisions**. Good intentions without right decisions produce frustration, delay, and repeated cycles. Many people start a new year with hope, but without discipline, conviction, or boundaries.

Many people pray for a better year, but never change their choices. Prayer is powerful, but prayer without obedience becomes empty words. God responds not only to what we ask, but to how we choose to live.

> *“Do not be deceived: God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.”*
> — **Galatians 6:7**

This means:

* Decisions are seeds
* Habits determine harvests
* Today’s choices shape tomorrow’s outcomes

This message is for **youth, teens, adults, and everyone in between**. No one is too young to choose wisely, and no one is too old to change direction. As we step into a new year, God is calling us to **right decisions**, especially when temptation presents itself disguised as something small, harmless, or understandable.

The question for this year is not, *“What do I want God to do for me?”*
But rather, *“What kind of decisions will I make before temptation comes?”*

---

## 1. LIFE IS A SERIES OF DAILY CHOICES

Life is not shaped by one big decision once a year—it is shaped by many small decisions made every day. Most people do not fall or succeed suddenly; they arrive there gradually through repeated choices.

Every single day, we choose:

* What we allow into our minds - Every action is first a thought. What you allow into your mind will eventually shape your behavior. what we watch, read, scroll through, and meditate on.
 > *“For as he thinks in his heart, so is he.”* — **Proverbs 23:7**
 If you want a changed life in the new year, you must first guard your thought life.

* What voices we listen to - Every voice speaking into your life is influencing your decisions—friends, music, social media, culture, and even inner thoughts. whose advice we value, whose opinions shape us, whose counsel we trust
> *“Bad company corrupts good character.”* — **1 Corinthians 15:33**
- Wrong environments make wrong choices feel normal.
- Right environments make obedience easier.

* What desires we nurture - what we allow to grow through attention, imagination, and repetition. What you choose consistently shows what you value deeply. God looks not only at actions but at the desires driving those actions.
> *“Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.”* — **Matthew 6:21**

* Who we walk with - You rarely rise above the spiritual level of those you walk closely with. The relationships and influences we permit close access to our lives
> *“He who walks with the wise grows wise.”* — **Proverbs 13:20**

* Who we obey - God’s Word, our feelings, culture, pressure, or convenience. Neutral ground does not exist in spiritual matters.
> *“No one can serve two masters.”* — **Matthew 6:24**
Every decision answers one question: 👉 Who is Lord in this moment—**God or self**?

> *“I call heaven and earth as witnesses today… I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing; therefore choose life.”*
> — **Deuteronomy 30:19**

* God never removes our power to choose—but He holds us responsible for how we use it. God never forces obedience. He invites, instructs, warns—and then allows us to choose.
> *“So then each of us shall give an account of himself to God.”* — **Romans 14:12**

These choices may seem small in the moment, but they are **never insignificant**. Small choices repeated consistently become **habits, and habits eventually become character**.God never removes our power to choose—but He does hold us accountable for how we use it. We cannot choose our consequences, but we do choose the decisions that lead to them. That is why spiritual growth is not about one emotional moment; it is about **daily obedience**. Every day we are moving either closer to God’s will or further from it—there is no **neutral ground.**

The question is not whether you are choosing, but what direction your choices are taking you.

## 2. UNDERSTANDING TEMPTATION CORRECTLY

Many believers misunderstand temptation. They assume it appears suddenly, randomly, or without warning. But Scripture teaches that temptation follows a **pattern** and targets specific areas of the heart.

Temptation is not accidental, and it is not forced upon us. It works by appealing to something **already present inside**.

> *“Each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed.”*
> — **James 1:14**

This verse reveals an important truth: temptation does not begin with the devil—it begins with **desire**. Satan does not create desires; he **exploits** them.

- He studies what you like
- He watches what you linger on
- He targets what you secretly desire

### Key Truth

👉 **Temptation only works where desire already exists.**

* Satan cannot tempt what you do not secretly want
* The enemy studies unmanaged desires and waits for opportunity
* Temptation gains strength when desire is entertained rather than confronted

If there is no desire, temptation has no hook. This is why two people can face the same situation—one falls, the other stands.


### The Real Battlefield Is the Heart

Many people try to fight temptation at the level of behavior, but by then the battle has already been going on internally for some time.

* Long before sin becomes action, it becomes **thought**
* Before thought, it becomes **desire**
* Before desire is acted upon, it is **allowed**

> *“Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it.”*
> — **Proverbs 4:23**

The heart is the control center of life. What you repeatedly allow into your heart will eventually influence your decisions, habits, and direction.


### Why Ignored Desires Become Dangerous

Uncontrolled desires do not remain neutral—they grow. When desires are not surrendered to God, they begin to demand satisfaction.

* What you tolerate today will control you tomorrow
* What you excuse will eventually enslave you
* What you hide will gain power over you

This is why temptation often feels sudden, even though it has been developing quietly for a long time.


### Right Understanding Leads to Right Response

When temptation comes, the goal is not merely to resist an action, but to **examine the desire behind it**. Victory begins when we submit our desires to God before they become demands.

Understanding temptation correctly helps us stop blaming circumstances, people, or the enemy—and start guarding our hearts intentionally.

Temptation loses much of its power when desire is surrendered early.

The question is not only, *“What am I being tempted to do?”*
But also, *“What desire am I allowing to grow unchecked?”*

##  3. “GOD WILL UNDERSTAND” — THE MOST DANGEROUS LIE

This is where many believers fall—not because they hate God, but because they **reason themselves into disobedience**. Often, sin is justified with seemingly harmless rationalizations that appear spiritual or understandable. These are the lies that make disobedience feel acceptable.

### Real-Life Temptation Scenarios

#### 1. The Relationship Compromise

A believer says:

> *“We love each other. We’re planning to marry anyway. God will understand.”* 
But God understands love—**He never excuses disobedience**. People allow their emotions and desires to justify boundaries being crossed.

#### 2. The Financial Shortcut

Someone alters numbers, lies on an application, or cheats at work and says:

> *“I have bills. I’m under pressure. God knows my situation.”* 
God knows your situation—but He also knows your **integrity**. Integrity is sacrificed for convenience or temporary relief.

#### 3. The Private Habit

A person repeatedly returns to pornography, lust, or secret sin:

> *“At least I’m not hurting anyone. God knows my weakness.”* 
God knows your weakness—but He also **provided a way of escape**. Secret sins like lust, greed, or addiction are minimized and hidden.

#### 4. The Unforgiveness Justification

Someone refuses to forgive:

> *“You don’t know what they did to me. God understands why I’m bitter.”*

God understands your pain—but He never **endorses bondage**. Holding onto resentment is excused as righteous indignation.


### Why This Lie Is Dangerous

- It confuses grace with permission. Grace empowers obedience; it does not excuse sin.
- It weakens self-discipline by making justification easier than repentance.
- It erodes spiritual sensitivity, making small compromises seem acceptable.

### Biblical Principle

God understands the heart, but **He never endorses rationalized sin**. True understanding leads to **conviction and repentance**, not excuses.

### Reflection

Ask yourself:

- Am I rationalizing sin because it feels harmless?
- Am I confusing God’s grace with permission to act on desire?
- Am I allowing my heart to justify what Scripture calls wrong?

Victory begins when we stop reasoning sin into acceptability and start submitting desires to God’s Word before temptation strikes. Grace is not permission to sin—it is **power to overcome it**.
> *“For the grace of God… teaches us to say ‘No’ to ungodliness.”*
> — **Titus 2:11–12**

## 4. GODLY PRINCIPLES PROTECT YOU BEFORE TEMPTATION COMES

Temptation often appears sudden, but victory does not happen by accident. Joseph did not suddenly become strong in Potiphar’s house—his strength was built **before temptation arrived**.

> *“How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?”*
> — **Genesis 39:9**

Joseph had already decided **who he was, and who he would not be**. His principles were established long before the test.

> *“Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself.”*
> — **Daniel 1:8**

Daniel’s commitment shows that **pre-decisions create power in pressure**. He did not wait to feel tempted before deciding; he chose God’s way in advance.

### Principles Are:

* **Decisions made ahead of pressure** — defining what you will and will not do before being tested
> *“I have made a covenant with my eyes.”* — **Job 31:1**
* **Boundaries set before emotions rise** — limits guard your heart and prevent compromise
> *“Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires.”* — **Song of Solomon 2:7**
* **Convictions formed before temptation speaks** — internal standards become your compass in difficult situations

**Godly principles**: 

**a) Tell you Where to stop, When to walk away, and Protect you when feelings lie**
**b) They Clarify Identity Before Temptation Speaks**
> *Joseph said, “How can I sin against God?”* - Not, “What if I get caught?”

**c) They shape your identity:**  “I don’t do that”; “That’s not who I am”; “I belong to God.”
> *“You are not your own, for you were bought at a price.”*— **1 Corinthians 6:19–20**

**d) They Silence the Devil’s Arguments**. Temptation often speaks in questions:

- “Did God really say?”
- “Is it that serious?”
- "where is it writen sex is sin?"
- “Who will know?”
But principles speak in statements, not debates. Jesus defeated temptation with settled truth, not emotional reasoning.
> *“It is written…”* — **Matthew 4:4**

- **Waiting Until Temptation Comes Is Already Too Late**
> “Make no provision for the flesh.” — Romans 13:14
- If you wait until: Desire is stirred, Opportunity is present, Pressure is high. **Then you are already fighting from behind.**
- **Strong warning for believers**: You cannot negotiate with sin and expect to win
- True victory is **intentional, premeditated, and rooted in principle**.

## 5. HOW TO BUILD GODLY PRINCIPLES THAT LAST

Godly principles are not formed in a moment—they are **built intentionally over time**. Just as a strong building requires a firm foundation and careful construction, spiritual principles require consistent attention, practice, and reinforcement.

If principles are what protect us before temptation comes, then learning how to build them is **essential for starting the new year well**.

> *“Therefore everyone who hears these words of Mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.”*
> — **Matthew 7:24**

### Steps to Build Godly Principles

1. **Define Core Values**

   * Decide what you will never compromise on (honesty, purity, integrity, obedience)
   * Write them down to make them tangible and visible

2. **Anchor Principles in Scripture, not feelings**

   * Every principle should align with God’s Word
   * Memorize key verses that will guide your decisions
   * When the Word is your foundation, feelings do not become your compass. **“Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.”** — Psalm 119:105
   
**Real-life scenario:**
A teen may feel something is right because friends approve—but Scripture may say otherwise.


3. **Create Boundaries and Limits**

   * Identify situations, people, or habits that trigger temptation
   * Set practical, enforceable limits to protect your heart and mind

4. **Discipline Daily Habits That Shape Character** 

   * Spiritual disciplines such as prayer, Bible study, worship, and accountability reinforce principles. **“Train yourself to be godly.”** — 1 Timothy 4:7
   * Habits strengthen character and prepare you for pressure
   * Principles are strengthened by daily practice.

5. **Practice Small Decisions Daily**

   * Principles grow when consistently applied in small, everyday choices
   * Each correct choice reinforces your spiritual foundation

6. **Evaluate and Adjust Regularly**

   * Periodically review your principles and boundaries
   * Adjust as needed without compromising God’s Word

7. **Surround Yourself with Accountability, Not Isolation**

   * Friends, mentors, or spiritual leaders help reinforce principles and provide correction when needed
   * Community supports perseverance and growth
   * Isolation is one of the enemy’s greatest strategies.
   * Godly principles grow stronger when they are shared and protected.
   
8. **Choose Environments That Support Your Convictions**

   * You cannot build godly principles in ungodly environments without resistance. **“Come out from among them and be separate.” — 2 Corinthians 6:17**
   * This does not mean isolation—but discernment. **Ask yourself:** Does this place strengthen my faith or weaken it?; Do these friendships push me toward God or away from Him?
   * Environment shapes behavior faster than intention.
9. **Depend on the Holy Spirit, Not Willpower**

   * Willpower fades. Grace sustains. **“Walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh.”** — Galatians 5:16
   * Victory is not about being strong—it is about being submitted and surrendered to the Holy Spirit

### Key Truth

Building godly principles is **a process, not a single event**. The choices you make today, and the disciplines you establish now, will determine your strength to resist temptation tomorrow. A life rooted in principle is a life protected when trials and temptations arrive.

## CONCLUSION: CHOOSE GOD — DAILY

- The new year does not need to be perfect to be powerful.
- You may face temptation—but you are not powerless.
- You may stumble—but you are not defeated.

> *“The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD.”*
> — **Psalm 37:23**

### Final Charge

* Make decisions **before** temptation comes
* Build principles, not just resolutions
* Choose God consistently, not conveniently

> *“Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom.”*
> — **Psalm 90:12**
