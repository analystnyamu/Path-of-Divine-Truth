If you are **unmarried, a youth, or a teenager** living righteously and walking in God’s will, you are a target for the enemy’s schemes. He knows that your **purity and focus on God** are powerful weapons against him, so he devises strategies to bring you down.

### How the Enemy Tricks You
- He may introduce someone into your life who appears to be a **friend** or a **potential romantic partner**.  
- Even when you know you are **not ready for a relationship**, the person may seem attractive or convincing.  
- The hidden agenda is to **distract, compromise, and weaken** your walk with God.

### The Danger of Soul Ties
- Entering into ungodly or premature relationships can create **soul ties**—emotional, spiritual, and physical bonds outside God’s will.  
- These ties often lead to:  
  - **Sexual temptation**  
  - **Loss of purity**  
  - **Confusion and guilt**  
  - **Distraction from God’s purpose**

### The Goal of the Enemy
- To **destroy your purity**  
- To **derail your destiny**  
- To **shift your focus away from God’s calling**  

### Key Takeaways for Youth and Singles
1. **Discern relationships carefully**—not everyone who comes into your life is sent by God.  
2. **Guard your purity and boundaries** (1 Thessalonians 4:3–4).  
3. **Stay rooted in God’s Word and prayer**, so you are not easily deceived.  
4. **Remember your purpose**—God has a plan for your life, and the enemy will try to sabotage it early.  


> **Your purity is precious. Protect it, guard your heart, and wait for God’s timing. The enemy wants to distract you, but God wants to establish you.**

## Guarding Against the Enemy’s Attacks in Relationships

To resist the enemy’s strategies, you must remain **vigilant in your spiritual life**. Only through the **guidance and power of the Holy Spirit** can you walk in God’s will and avoid deception.


### For Teenagers
- **Do not engage in romantic relationships** while young.  
- Early relationships often open the door to **temptation, compromise, and distraction**.  
- The enemy will try to lure you into choices that weaken your faith and damage your future.

### For Singles Seeking a Spouse
- Seek the **Holy Spirit’s direction** before committing to anyone.  
- The devil often sends **counterfeit partners** who appear perfect on the surface.  
- If you are spiritually discerning, you will notice **red flags**—pay attention to them.  

### The Warning Against Unequal Yoking
- As believers, we must not be unequally yoked:  
  > *“Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what fellowship has righteousness with lawlessness? And what communion has light with darkness?”* (2 Corinthians 6:14)  
- **Do not compromise** by marrying someone who does not share your faith.  
- Never assume you can **change or convert them after marriage**—this often leads to regret and spiritual struggles.

### Key Takeaways
1. **Wait for God’s timing.** It is better to remain single than to settle for a partner who will pull you away from Christ.  
2. **Be vigilant in prayer.** Pray consistently for wisdom and discernment.  
3. **Stay rooted in God’s Word.** Scripture is your safeguard against deception.  
4. **Depend on the Holy Spirit.** He will open your eyes to the truth and protect you from counterfeits.
