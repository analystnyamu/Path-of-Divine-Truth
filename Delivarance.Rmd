# Dear Sister,

I’ve heard your story, and my heart truly goes out to you. You’ve been through so much — pain, rejection, confusion, and deep spiritual battles. I want to first remind you of this: God sees you, and His love for you is immeasurable.

However, I must speak the truth to you in love. Seeking help from diviners, spiritualists, or anyone outside of God’s will only opens dangerous doors in your life. These practices may seem like they offer relief, but they do not come from God and only lead to deception and bondage. The Bible clearly warns us in **Leviticus 19:31**:  
*"Do not turn to mediums or seek out spiritists, for you will be defiled by them. I am the Lord your God."*  
What may appear harmless or even helpful is, in fact, inviting **spiritual oppression** such as the rejection and confusion you’ve been experiencing.

But here’s the **good news**: Jesus came to set the captives free! And you are now in a church that believes in the power of deliverance through **Jesus Christ**. This is no accident; God has brought you here to heal you, restore your destiny, and give you a fresh start.

**“If the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.”** — **John 8:36**

What you need to do now is:

### **1. True Repentance**
Confess and turn away from all past involvement with diviners, spiritualists, or any ungodly practices. **Renounce them completely**. Repentance is the first step in breaking the spiritual chains holding you back.

### **2. Surrender Your Life to Christ**
This is crucial. If you have not fully surrendered your life to Jesus, now is the time. Your deliverance begins with making Him your **Lord and Savior**. When you **surrender** your life to Christ, you open the door for His healing and restoration in every area of your life. Ask Him to take full control of your heart, emotions, and life.

### **3. Deliverance Prayers**

Allow the leaders of your church, who believe in the power of **deliverance**, pray for you. The church you are in, **CFF**, is a **great church** where God has led you to experience healing and freedom. They have a dedicated **Deliverance and Prayer Day every Friday** (and also on Sundays), where you can come and receive prayer in agreement with powerful faith-filled believers. You can even visit CFF Donholm one of the Friday or Sunday. But anywhere you are you can still receive delivarance, it starts from you accepting Christ.

During these times, the **power of Jesus** is at work, and every spiritual chain that has held you captive will be broken. These prayers are not just rituals—they are **a divine encounter** with the Holy Spirit that will bring you **restoration** and **freedom**. The Lord will meet you there, and you will see His hand at work in your life.

Remember, **it is God who has brought you to CFF Donholm**. He has a specific purpose for you being there, and He will use the **church’s deliverance ministry** to help you break free from every bondage. Trust that **God’s timing** and His plan are perfect for your restoration.

Let the **power of prayer and fasting** be a catalyst for you to experience freedom and wholeness. As you commit to participating in these **deliverance sessions**, you will walk in **freedom**, healing, and victory through **Jesus Christ**.


### **4. Stay in the Word of God**
Make God’s Word your daily foundation. **The Bible** is your guide, and it is through the **truth** in His Word that you will be able to break free from every lie the enemy has sown into your life. Fill your heart with His promises of healing, restoration, and freedom.

### **5. Walk in Obedience**
Avoid any activity or relationship that connects you to your past and opens the door to spiritual attack. Walk in **holiness**, commit to prayer, and stay in **fellowship** with other believers. The power to stay free comes through obedience to God’s Word.

Remember, **you are not cursed**; you are **called** by God. What the enemy intended for evil, God will use for good — but only if you fully turn to Him. The story of your life is **not over**. Healing, restoration, and joy are available to you through Jesus Christ.

This is **your season of freedom**. You no longer need to seek help from anyone other than **Jesus**. His power is more than enough to heal you and set you free. You are not alone on this journey; I, along with others who care, am here to walk with you.
