## Newly Married Couples: Fight the Battle Through Prayer**

Marriage is not just a union between two people—it is also a **covenant before God**. That is why, for newly married couples, the wedding day is **not the finish line but the starting point of a spiritual journey**. The enemy understands the power of a godly marriage and will often target it with spiritual attacks.

### Why Marriages Are Targeted
- **The enemy seeks to destroy what God has blessed.**  
- Sometimes, those who once admired or desired to marry you may become instruments of the enemy.  
- These individuals can be used to **sow discord, jealousy, or division** in your marriage.

### The Call to Vigilance
- This is **not the time for complacency**.  
- Couples must be committed to **prayer without ceasing** (1 Thessalonians 5:17).  
- Many marital struggles are not purely natural; they may have **spiritual roots**.

### Examples of Spiritual Attacks
- The enemy may influence close friends or past acquaintances harboring secret desires.  
- Some may engage in **occult practices**—such as womb-blocking rituals—designed to hinder fruitfulness.  
- These attacks can manifest in **barrenness, health issues, or constant conflict**.

### Key Message
- **Prayer is your greatest weapon.** A praying couple is a protected couple.  
- Spiritual vigilance ensures that no scheme of the enemy prospers against your marriage.  
- Remember: *“What God has joined together, let no man separate.”* (Mark 10:9)


### Takeaway for Couples
1. Guard your marriage through **daily prayer and fasting when led by the Holy Spirit**.  
2. Stay discerning—**not every problem is natural; some are spiritual in nature**.  
3. Stand together in unity, relying on God’s word and His promises of protection.  

> **Your marriage is a divine covenant—protect it with prayer, cover it with God’s Word, and walk in unity to overcome every spiritual attack.**


## The Spiritual Root of Physical Issues

Not all physical conditions have purely natural causes. **Cramps, fibroids, cysts, and other fertility-related challenges** may sometimes have a **spiritual root**, especially when there are no clear medical explanations—such as contraceptive use or other known triggers.

In such cases, you may visit multiple doctors, undergo countless fertility tests, and still find no answers. This can lead to **frustration, discouragement, and spiritual confusion**. You may even begin to question: *“Why would God allow this to happen to me?”*  and in the process fail to recognize the true source of the attack.  
Remember that: 

- The enemy’s goal is not only to afflict your body but also to **attack your faith**.  
- He wants you to **doubt God’s goodness** and **abandon your trust in Him**.  
- When precious things are at stake—your marriage, your children, your destiny—the enemy will attempt to use fear, delay, and intimidation to break you down.

This is why **spiritual support and community** are vital. Scripture reminds us:  
> *“Two are better than one… If either of them falls down, one can help the other up.”* (Ecclesiastes 4:9–10)

### Encouragement
Even when medicine cannot explain your pain, **God sees you, knows you, and has not abandoned you**. The battle may be spiritual, but your victory is assured in Christ.  

> **Hold fast to your faith, stay covered in prayer, and never forget that God’s purpose for your life is greater than any attack of the enemy.**

## Overcoming the Enemy's Attacks

There will be seasons when **God seems silent**. Just as He withdrew from **Hezekiah to test him** (2 Chronicles 32:31), God may allow moments of silence to see how you will respond. Though Hezekiah faltered, God’s faithfulness never failed—and His promises still stand.

### How to Respond When God Seems Silent
- **Do not complain or speak negatively** about your circumstances.  
- **Stay steadfast in prayer**—your prayers can overturn the enemy’s rituals and cause his attacks to backfire.  
- Persevere in faith, knowing that **silence does not mean abandonment**; it may be a test to refine and strengthen you.

### Understanding the True Enemy
- The people who persecute you or attempt to use dark powers against you are **not your true enemies**.  
- They are **human agents manipulated by the enemy**.  
- As believers, our call is to **pray for their deliverance**, not curse them (Matthew 5:44).  
- Jesus modeled this perfectly, showing love even to those who hated and persecuted Him.

### The Fate of the Wicked vs. the Believer
- The **wicked remain in danger** if they continue unprotected outside God’s mercy; their judgment is certain unless they repent.  
- For believers, **the Lord is our protector**:  
  - In life, He guards us against destruction.  
  - In death, we rest in His will and presence.  


> **Remain steadfast in prayer, show love to those who oppose you, and trust God’s faithfulness—He is your protector and your victory.**
