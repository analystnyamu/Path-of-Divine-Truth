# 💌 Letter To My Darling Wife

**Dear Love,**

We are human, living in a world full of challenges and surrounded by many voices — some uplifting, others meant to distract us from God’s truth. Yet, even in the midst of all this, **God gave us each other — to love, to support, and to walk side by side in unity.**

Marriage is more than just a partnership; it is **a reflection of God’s divine design.** According to His Word, the purpose of marriage is to:

- **Reflect the image of God.**  
- **Provide companionship and mutual support.**  
- **Form a family and raise godly children.**  
- **Model Christ’s relationship with the Church.**  
- **Offer love, intimacy, and fulfillment within a committed bond.**  
- **Serve God together as one heart and one spirit.**  

The Bible reminds us that *“two cannot walk together unless they are in agreement”* — **Amos 3:3.** From the beginning, we agreed that, by God’s will, we would raise children — perhaps four, if He so blesses us. **Children are gifts from God; even having one is a great favor and blessing.** We may not know what kind of person each child will grow to become, but **God does, and His plans are always perfect.**

I understand that raising even one child is not easy. It takes patience, strength, and so much grace. But **God never gives us more than we can bear.** The struggles that come during pregnancy or parenthood are not from Him — they come from **the enemy who tries to frustrate every good thing God has planned.** Yet, **God promises to strengthen us when we feel weary and to fight for us when we call on Him.**  
> *“Come to Me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.”* — **Matthew 11:28**

Lately, I’ve noticed that you’ve been speaking as if you only want one child, and that having more feels unnecessary. I completely understand how tired and overwhelmed you may feel right now — physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Parenthood changes us deeply. But I want to gently remind you that **our words carry power.**  
> *“Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those who love it will eat its fruit.”* — **Proverbs 18:21**

Sometimes, when we’re exhausted, we may express our pain without realizing that **our words can open doors spiritually.** The enemy listens, waiting for a chance to use our own words against us. That’s why we’re taught to **be careful not to curse ourselves or our future with what we say.**

When we declare that we don’t see the importance of having more children, we might unknowingly speak against our own blessings. **Saying that children are not important can also affect how our hearts connect to the children we have** — for if something is *“not important,”* it’s hard to nurture it fully. You are such a loving and caring woman, and I know in your heart that you don’t mean to speak harm — it’s just the **weight of life, fatigue, and all that comes with motherhood.** But **God wants us to speak life, hope, and faith even when we are weary.**

**Remember, love, that being able to bring forth life is a precious favor from God.** Just as Mary was chosen to bring our Lord Jesus Christ into the world, **you too are chosen to bring forth life for His purpose.** There’s no greater honor than that.

### 💞 Walking in Oneness and Spiritual Nakedness

**As a couple, we are called to be “naked and unashamed” before each other** — not just physically, but emotionally and spiritually.  
> *“And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.”* — **Genesis 2:25**

This means being open, honest, and vulnerable — sharing our fears, weaknesses, and struggles without judgment. There will be times when one of us feels weak in faith, strength, or grace. During those moments, **we are called to help one another**, to lift each other up in love, and to cover each other’s weakness with grace rather than criticism.  
> *“Carry each other’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.”* — **Galatians 6:2**

When our faith wavers, we must not distance ourselves but draw closer — for **vulnerability is when the enemy tries hardest to plant doubt, pride, or division.** That’s why **we must guard our unity and protect our hearts with prayer and humility.**

We also need to be careful not to let **what we are daily exposed to — the world’s opinions, education, or culture — reshape our faith or drift us away from God’s purpose.**  
> *“Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind.”* — **Romans 12:2**

Let’s also watch against **pride**, which can quietly grow when we begin to feel that one of us is always right and the other is wrong. Pride is one of the enemy’s greatest tools to divide love.  
> *“Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.”* — **Proverbs 16:18**

When we correct each other in love, it should draw us closer, not apart. Correction done in love is not condemnation — it is a way of protecting our union from unseen traps.  
> *“Faithful are the wounds of a friend, but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.”* — **Proverbs 27:6**

So, my love, when I speak or remind you of something in love, know it’s because I care deeply about our spiritual well-being and the destiny God has placed in our family. And when you correct me, I’ll receive it with the same humility — because **our goal is not to win an argument, but to win together.**

### ❤️ Our Covenant Together

**We are a team** — I’m here for you in every way, and you are there for me. **When you feel weak, I will help you stand; when I feel low, I know you will lift me too.** Let’s continue to **seek God together before making decisions about our family, trusting that His plan is far greater than ours.**

**You are not alone in this journey** — not in marriage, not in motherhood, not in faith. **Together, with His grace, we will walk this path, raise the children He blesses us with, and live out His purpose for our family.**

With all my love,  
**Your Husband**
