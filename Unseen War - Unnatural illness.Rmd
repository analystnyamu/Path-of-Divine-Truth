> "For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places." - Ephesians 6:12 (NKJV)

Many of the stubborn, debilitating sicknesses we battle today are not natural in origin. They are spiritual attacks, engineered in the kingdom of darkness. These attacks can be initiated through a simple incantation, a strand of hair, a name spoken at midnight, or by individuals who understand spiritual laws and work for the enemy.

No medicine can cure what is not medical. I know this is a hard truth, but many illnesses are not biological—they are demonic. If you or someone you love has been battling a stubborn illness that defies medicine, what you are about to read may be your missing answer. This is spiritual intelligence that can save a life.

## The Target: Why the Enemy Comes for You

If you are a believing Christian with a passion for knowing God and diligently doing His work—converting souls, delivering the possessed, helping captives find freedom—you are public enemy number one to the devil. You are destroying his work, and for that, you are a high-value target. Your prayers, worship, and glorification of Almighty God through Christ Jesus disturb his assignments and draw his fiercest opposition.

## The Mechanism of Attack: How Infirmity is Assigned

The agents of darkness seldom need a physical weapon. Sometimes, all they require is your photograph, your name, a personal item, or even a small offering of blood. Through chanting, they call upon spirits of infirmity that perfectly mimic real diseases.

For instance, if they want to attack you with cancer, a spirit will attach itself to you, manifesting symptoms that look, smell, and feel like real cancer—so convincing it fools the best doctors. This "cancer" moves from one stage to another with terrifying speed, and within months or even weeks, you can die if you don't realize it is a satanic attack.

As Psalm 91 describes, there are *"arrows that fly by day,"* *"pestilence that stalks in darkness,"* and *"the plague that destroys at noon."* These are descriptors of spiritual warfare. This kind of attack does not yield to general prayers; it requires targeted, authoritative prayers that confront the source.

## The Fatal Flaw: How Believers Unknowingly Grant Access

Many Christians have spiritual flaws that act as open doors for attack. The most common is a **negative confession**. When you speak weakness and defeat with your own mouth, you give the enemy legal ground to attack.

-   "I'm just tired."
-   "I think I'm losing my mind."
-   "I don't think God hears me anymore."
-   "I feel confused and hopeless."

In the demonic realm, words like these are permissions. If you say, "I am tired," you invite a spirit of heaviness (Isaiah 61:3). A monitoring spirit records what you speak; if it is negative, they implement it at once. This can lead to a foggy mind, jumbled thoughts, night terrors, hallucinations, and eventually, a diagnosis of "severe depression with psychotic symptoms." You are given pills for a chemical imbalance when the root cause is a spiritual invasion.

## The Battle for Your Lineage: Generational Curses and Patterns

The enemy often uses doors opened by your forefathers. If past generations engaged in sexual sin, witchcraft, blood sacrifices, or made covenants with dark powers, these agreements are legally binding in the spirit realm and can propagate for generations.

A doctor will call it a "genetic mutation" or a "family trait," but it is often a spirit of infirmity that was given permission long ago. Patterns repeat: a history of diabetes, cancer, or even specific tragedies. These are the works of familiar spirits operating through opened doors.

> **Beware:** This cannot be broken without the power of God through Christ Jesus. Be wary of false prophets who demand money to break these curses. The solution is full surrender to Christ. The blood of Jesus Christ speaks a louder word than any generational curse (Galatians 3:13).

## The Warfare Strategy: How to Fight and Win

When you are under attack and doctors give negative reports, **do not accept them**. If you are attacked with a spirit of paralysis and told you will never walk again, refuse that word and declare your healing in Jesus' name.

### 1. Understand Your Authority
The Scripture is clear: *"Behold, I have given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall hurt you"* (Luke 10:19). You have the power. The name of Jesus and His blood work powerfully for those who know how to use them according to the Word.

### 2. Wear Your Full Armor (Ephesians 6:10-18)
-   **The Word of God** is your sword.
-   **Your faith** is your shield against the enemy's arrows.
-   **Salvation** protects your mind.
-   **Righteousness** guards your heart.
-   The **gospel of peace** prepares you to stand firm.

### 3. Pray with the Word
Do not complain to God or question Him in your suffering. Instead, speak boldly to the mountain. Command the spirit of infirmity to leave. *The one in you is greater than the one in the world* (1 John 4:4).

### 4. Engage in Fasting
Some spirits are so stubborn that they only leave through **prayer and fasting** (Matthew 17:21). A targeted fast can break long-standing attacks.

### 5. Anoint and Consecrate
Have a true elder or pastor anoint you with oil (James 5:14). Use anointing oil on your head, chest, and doorposts, declaring Psalm 91 over your dwelling.

## A Call to Vigilance

### For Marriages
The wedding is not the end; it is the beginning of a war. The enemy can use jealous admirers to perform rituals, invoking spirits of barrenness that cause unexplained medical conditions. **Fight for your marriage and your family on your knees.**

### For Youth and Singles
The enemy will send a "perfect" person to make you compromise your faith, creating soul ties that destroy your destiny. **Do not be yoked with unbelievers** (2 Corinthians 6:14). Be vigilant and let the Holy Spirit guide you. Your bold confession of Christ has placed you on the enemy's radar.

## Your Victory is Assured

Remember, we do not fight against people, but against spiritual forces. Do not hate the human agents used against you; they are slaves who need deliverance. Pray for them.

If you are under attack, **rise up and fight**. Declare war. Demonic sickness does not leave politely; it leaves when it is violently resisted with spiritual truth and divine power.

Sickness is not always natural. And when it's not, pills won't help. It takes power, not prescriptions. And that power is in the name of Jesus Christ.

If you have never fully surrendered your life to Him, do it now. That is your first and greatest weapon. Without His blood, you are fighting hell with a water gun. But with Him, demons bow, altars collapse, and sickness flees.

**You shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the Lord.** (Psalm 118:17)
