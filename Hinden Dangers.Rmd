As someone with a **divine gift**—whether it's prophetic, healing, teaching, leadership, or any other gift from God—you may find yourself under spiritual attack in ways that are not always visible to the natural eye. One of the most insidious forms of oppression is **spiritual molestation**—a tactic the enemy uses to defile and distort the gifts God has placed within you. These attacks can manifest in dreams, where spirits of darkness, masquerading as familiar or attractive figures, try to engage with you sexually or manipulate you in other ways.

### **Sexual Sin and Its Connection to Spiritual Molestation**

The **root cause** of these spiritual attacks often begins with **sexual sin**. Whether it's through fornication, pornography, sexual immorality, or even sleeping with someone who has such spirits, these actions open doors that give the enemy access to your life. Sexual sin creates **spiritual doors** that invite **demonic oppression**, and once these doors are opened, the enemy can invade your dreams, causing defilement and weakening your connection with God.

The **enemy** seeks to hijack your **divine gift** by defiling your spirit through these immoral dreams. When these spirits have access to your mind and spirit, they can distort the gift God has placed within you, turning it into a tool for darkness instead of light. The **spiritual molestation** often manifests in dreams where you experience intimate relations with **unknown entities** or even people you know. These encounters may seem harmless at first, but they are **demonic** in nature, designed to taint your spirit and hinder your relationship with God.

### **The Impact of Sexual Sin and Dreams on Your Divine Gift**

When you engage in sexual sin, you invite spirits of impurity, lust, and even defilement into your life. These spirits not only affect your physical actions but also spiritually weaken your gifts and calling. You may experience:

- **Spiritual confusion** – The clarity with which you once heard from God is now clouded.
- **Defilement of your anointing** – Your gift becomes polluted, and it no longer serves its divine purpose.
- **Loss of Divine Connection**: These attacks hinder your connection to God’s Holy Spirit, blocking the flow of divine **revelation** and guidance. As your spirit becomes bound, your gift is no longer in its rightful place—used for God’s glory—but is instead misused for **demonic purposes**.
- **Pollution of Spiritual Purity**: Sexual dreams and molestation in the spirit realm can pollute your **spiritual purity**. This opens the door for **spiritual contamination** that affects both your **body** and **spirit**, leaving you open to manipulation.
- **Hijacking Your Gift**: When the enemy tarnishes your purity, it becomes easier for him to manipulate your divine gift. Spiritual molestation weakens your **spiritual sensitivity**, clouding your ability to receive clear direction from God and diminishing the effectiveness of your gift.

The enemy's goal is to **distract, distort, and delay** your divine purpose by attacking your spirit through **sexual dreams** and **immorality**. These attacks are designed to rob you of your spiritual power and cause you to feel disconnected from God, even though you may still have an active gift. It **turns your gift into a tool for demonic deception**, where you may begin using it for **false purposes** or operate in a **counterfeit anointing**.


#### **Scripture Reference**  
*“Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.”* — **1 Corinthians 6:9-10**  
This passage serves as a stark reminder that **sexual immorality** and other sins block our access to God's kingdom. They hinder our spiritual growth and can even rob us of our prophetic or spiritual gifts. If you have experienced sexual dreams or have been molested spiritually in your sleep, it's crucial to address the root cause of **sexual sin** in your life and take steps toward **deliverance**.

### **When Does This Spiritual Attack Begin?**

These attacks don't happen overnight; they often begin after **opening doors** to sexual sin. This can happen in various ways:

- **Fornication** – Engaging in sexual relationships outside of marriage.
- **Pornography** – Consuming sexually explicit material, which exposes you to demonic influences.
- **Sexual Immorality** – Any sexual activity outside of the bounds of God’s design, including adultery or lustful behavior.
- **Involvement with People Carrying Unclean Spirits**: Sleeping with someone who is involved in witchcraft, **spiritual deception**, or is under **demonic influence** can open a gateway to these attacks. Their **spiritual contamination** can be transferred to you through intimacy.
- **Previous Soul Ties and Relationships**: Past relationships where sexual boundaries were crossed, especially those involving **idolatry**, **witchcraft**, or spiritual deception, may result in **soul ties** that invite **sexual spirits**. These ties can remain and cause spiritual molestation through dreams.


Once these doors are opened, the enemy has legal access to you, and he can attack you in your dreams. These dreams may initially seem innocent but are actually **demonic attempts to distort your gift** and confuse your spirit. If you have opened any of these doors, it is crucial to **repent**, **renounce**, and **break any agreements** you’ve made with the enemy, and ask for **deliverance**.

### **Breaking Free from Sexual Sin and Spiritual Molestation**

If you have been attacked in your dreams or are experiencing spiritual molestation, it is not too late to regain your purity and freedom. Through **true repentance** and seeking **deliverance in Christ**, you can break the cycle of spiritual oppression and purify your divine gift. The enemy has no claim over you when you submit fully to Christ.

#### **Steps to Freedom:**

1. **Confession and Repentance** – The first step to freedom is **surrendering your life to Christ** through **true repentance**. Confess and turn away from all sexual sin and past immoral behaviors. Acknowledge any areas of defilement in your life and ask God to purify your spirit. Repentance is not just about feeling sorry for past mistakes; it’s about making a conscious decision to **align your heart** with God's will and walk away from the sinful patterns that have opened doors to spiritual attacks. Confess any past sins or ties to the occult that may have opened doors for these attacks. Ask for forgiveness and purification through the **blood of Jesus**.

2. **Renounce and Break the Covenant** – **Renounce** any agreements you have unknowingly or knowingly made with demonic spirits, particularly those that have entered through sexual sin and sexual dreams or spiritual molestation you’ve experienced. These agreements may include curses, unholy covenants, or any bond with spirits of lust, defilement, or immorality. Declare that you no longer accept these influences and break all ties with the enemy, in Jesus' name. 

3. **Deliverance Prayer** – Seek deliverance through prayer, asking the Holy Spirit to **cleanse your mind, spirit, and body** from all forms of spiritual molestation and impurity. Command any **demonic spirits** or unclean influences that have attached themselves to you to leave, in the authority of Jesus Christ. Declare that the **power of the Holy Spirit** is now filling you, restoring **purity**, **holiness**, and **spiritual clarity**. If needed, seek prayer and support from a trusted, spiritually mature believer who can help you break these strongholds. Through **deliverance**, you will regain your freedom from **demonic influence** and walk in the **fullness** of your divine calling, with clarity and strength.

4. **Surrender to Christ's Lordship** – **Surrender** every area of your life to Christ and invite Him to reign over your thoughts, desires, and actions. Embrace His lordship, and **submit to His guidance** through His Word. Allow His Word to be the guiding principle of your life, teaching you how to live in a manner that honors Him and keeps you free from spiritual oppression.

5. **Guard Your Heart** – **Live a life of holiness and sexual purity** by committing yourself to walk in the ways of the Lord. Surround yourself with people, environments, and media that align with God's truth. **Avoid situations** or relationships that could open doors to temptation or spiritual attack. Continually **renew your mind** through the Word of God, and stay vigilant to the enemy's schemes.

6. **Live by the Word of God** – The **Word of God** is a lamp to your feet and a light to your path (Psalm 119:105). Embrace daily Bible study and meditation to grow in understanding and obedience to God’s Word. Allow the **truth of the Scriptures** to shape your thoughts, actions, and desires. Let the Word become the foundation of your life, guiding you in purity, holiness, and freedom from the enemy’s lies.

**By walking in repentance, surrendering your life fully to Christ, and living according to His Word, you open the door to true freedom**. Your divine gift will be protected, your spiritual purity restored, and you will walk in the fullness of the purpose God has prepared for you.

### **Scripture Reference**  
*“Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.”* — **2 Corinthians 3:17**  
The Spirit of God brings freedom, and when you choose to surrender your life and gifts to Him, He will break every chain of sexual sin and spiritual oppression. The enemy will no longer have any hold on your life, and you will walk in the fullness of your divine purpose.

**Remember**: You were created with a **divine calling**. Don't allow the enemy to steal, distort, or pervert the gift God has given you through sexual sin or spiritual molestation. Stand firm in your identity in Christ and walk in the **freedom** He has given you.

#### **Scripture Reference**  
*“The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly.”* — **John 10:10**  
This reminds us that the enemy's goal is to steal your gift, but Christ offers **freedom** and **life** through His power.

### 💖 **Restoration and Repositioning**
Through **prayer, repentance, and deliverance**, God will restore you to the **fullness of your divine calling**. His **Holy Spirit** will guide you, purify your heart, and help you use your gift for His glory. You are not meant to be bound or hindered by any demonic schemes. When you surrender your life fully to God, He will remove every obstacle and empower you to walk in the **full authority** He has given you.

**Remember, your gift is powerful, but it must be kept pure and surrendered to God alone. The enemy will stop at nothing to distort it, but through Christ, you have the power to stand strong and protect your divine calling.**
