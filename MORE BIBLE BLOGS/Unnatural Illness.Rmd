## When Illness is Not Natural: Understanding Spiritual Attacks

When an illness is not natural, doctors often name it after a known disease to make sense of its symptoms. However, some sicknesses are not of this world—they are spiritual attacks. These attacks can come in many forms: a simple incantation, a strand of hair, a name spoken at midnight, or through individuals who work for the enemy and understand spiritual laws. Such illnesses cannot be cured by medicine, for they are not natural.

Though this may be difficult to accept, many of the afflictions we face today are not medical—they are demonic in nature. In this blog, I will explore the various strategies the enemy uses to target individuals and how you can protect yourself and your family from these attacks. If you or someone you love is battling a persistent, stubborn illness, what you are about to read could be the answer you've been searching for.

What follows is spiritual intelligence that could save a life—perhaps even your own.

## Spiritual Awareness and Protection

If you are a believer in Christ, it is crucial to awaken to the unseen spiritual battle that constantly surrounds you. **This message is for you.** As a believer in Christ, you are called not only to live a life that glorifies God but also to actively disturb the enemy’s kingdom. Whether through **prayer**, **worship**, or **living a life that reflects Christ's love and truth**, you are a target for spiritual attack. 

### The Enemy's Agenda

The enemy, who is **"the god of this world"** (2 Corinthians 4:4), seeks to hinder those who are faithfully working for God. His primary goal is to stop the advancement of the **gospel**, hinder those who are **delivering the oppressed**, and prevent the **setting of captives free**. As you engage in this divine work, you become a **prime target** for attack. **The enemy does not want the kingdom of God to grow**, and he will stop at nothing to prevent you from fulfilling God's purpose in your life.

### You Are an Enemy of the Devil

As a **true Christian**—one who passionately seeks to know God and do His will—you are **automatically an enemy of the devil**. Your actions, whether it’s praying for others, preaching the Word of God, or serving those in need, are seen as **direct threats** to the enemy's kingdom. 

**Remember**: Everything you do to glorify God makes you **a target of spiritual warfare**. 

### Expect Attacks

**As a believer, expect attacks.** You will face challenges, both physical and spiritual, because of the work you are doing for God's kingdom. But **do not be discouraged**, for the Bible assures us that **God’s protection is always with us** in times of trouble. When we walk in **faith**, **prayer**, and **obedience**, we can stand firm against the enemy's schemes.

## Tools the Enemy Uses

The enemy's agents of attack do not always require physical weapons to target you. In fact, **sometimes, all they need is your photograph, your name, or even personal items**. These objects can serve as spiritual entry points, giving the enemy permission to send attacks your way. At times, even a small offering of **blood** can be enough to initiate a spiritual assault.

### Spiritual Means of Attack

One of the most common methods the enemy employs is the use of **spiritual means**, such as **chanting**, **incantations**, or **rituals**, to summon **spirits of infirmity**. These spirits can be sent to attach themselves to a person, causing them to experience real, debilitating physical symptoms that mimic illnesses known to the medical world. 

### Example: Demonic Illness Mimicking Cancer

For example, if the enemy wants to **attack you with cancer**, a **spirit of infirmity** may attach itself to you in such a way that it mirrors every symptom of the disease. The **symptoms may feel incredibly real** and even **convincing** to medical professionals. **The cancer may appear genuine**, fooling even the most skilled doctors, who will conduct test after test and tell you that you have an **aggressive form of cancer**. This form of sickness may progress **at an alarming rate**—within **months, weeks, or even days**—leading you to believe that you are facing a life-threatening illness.

However, the true source of this affliction is not natural; it is **spiritual** in origin. **When you understand that the sickness may be a demonic attack**, you can take action to resist it spiritually and stand in the authority of Christ, who has already won victory over the enemy.

## The Scriptures on Spiritual Warfare

The Bible provides deep insight into the reality of spiritual warfare, and **Psalm 91** is one of the most powerful chapters on the subject. It speaks of the **arrows that are thrown during the day** and **diseases that strike at night**, which are metaphorical representations of **spiritual attacks**.

> _“Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day; Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.”_  
> **Psalm 91:5-6**

These **terrors of the night** are often spiritual in nature. The arrow represents attacks that come unexpectedly, while the pestilence symbolizes diseases that strike without warning. These are not merely physical attacks; they are **spiritual forces** sent to hinder, harm, or destroy believers. 

### Key Insight: **Spiritual Attacks Aren’t Always Obvious**

This kind of warfare is not something that can be fought with shallow or general prayers. **It requires targeted, powerful prayers that confront the source of the attack directly**. **Spiritual warfare is not passive**—you must actively engage in battle through **prayer, fasting, and using the Word of God** as your weapon.

### The Danger of Lukewarmness

**If you are a lukewarm Christian**, you may not fully recognize the spiritual forces at play. **Spiritual attacks can be subtle**, and sometimes, we don’t even realize that we are under attack until the situation escalates. When you are unaware, or not spiritually vigilant, you may fail to discern the source of your struggles.

> _“Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.”_  
> **1 Peter 5:8**

Many Christians, even those who are prayerful, may become discouraged during trials. **The enemy uses fear to paralyze** you, making you question God’s goodness, and causing you to lose faith. **The ultimate goal of the enemy is to get you to stop trusting in God**, leading to **discouragement, doubt**, and eventually **spiritual defeat**.

> _“For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.”_  
> **Ephesians 6:12**

> _“No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and their righteousness is of me, saith the Lord.”_  
> **Isaiah 54:17**

**You are more than a conqueror** through Jesus Christ. When you rely on His strength, the enemy cannot defeat you, and no spiritual attack can harm you.

## The Power You Possess

As a Christian, **you have been endowed with tremendous power** through your relationship with Christ. Many believers are unaware of the full extent of this power because they do not delve deeply into the Word of God. The **enemy** thrives on this ignorance, using it as an opportunity to sow **doubt**, **fear**, and **confusion**. However, the Bible is clear that you have been given **authority over the powers of darkness** through Christ.

> _“Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.”_  
> **Luke 10:19**

### The Authority in Christ

When you are baptized, you are not only saved, but you are also **empowered** to operate in the name of Jesus. The Bible promises that **signs and wonders will follow you** as a believer in Christ. You have the **divine authority** to cast out demons, heal the sick, and command the enemy to flee in Jesus' name.

> _“And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.”_  
> **Mark 16:17-18**

When you **pray** with **the Word of God**, the **enemy cannot withstand you**. The Word is **the sword of the Spirit**, and with it, you can cut down every lie, every attack, and every obstacle the enemy throws your way.

> _“For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.”_  
> **Hebrews 4:12**

### The Full Armor of God

The Bible describes the **armor of God** in Ephesians 6:10-18, which is essential for every believer. It is not a mere metaphor, but a **spiritual protection** that you must intentionally **wear** to withstand the attacks of the enemy.

- **The Word of God** is the **sword of the Spirit** (Ephesians 6:17).
- **Faith** acts as a shield that extinguishes all the flaming allows of the enemy (Ephesians 6:16).
- **Salvation** is your helmet, protecting your mind from evil thoughts and confusion (Ephesians 6:17).
- **Righteousness** is the breastplate that guards your heart from the enemy's schemes (Ephesians 6:14).
- **Gospel of Peace** is like shoes that protect your walk, keeping you grounded in the gospel (Ephesians 6:15).

### Key Insight: **When You Understand and Walk in Faith, the Enemy Will Flee**

When you grasp the truth of **who you are in Christ** and actively apply the **power of God's Word**, you will become an unstoppable force against the forces of darkness. **The enemy cannot stand against you** when you speak the Word with confidence and walk in faith.

> _“Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.”_  
> **James 4:7**

> _“For I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.”_  
> **Philippians 4:13**

With Christ, **you are more than a conqueror** (Romans 8:37), and the enemy will be forced to recognize the power and authority you walk in.

## Promises of Protection

God’s Word is filled with promises of **protection** and **provision** for those who live in righteousness. These promises serve as a powerful shield against the attacks of the enemy. When you align yourself with God's will and stand firm in faith, you are assured that no weapon formed against you will prosper.

> _“I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD.”_  
> **Psalm 118:17**  

This scripture is a powerful declaration against any **spiritual attack** meant to harm or destroy you. It is a reminder that God has **sovereign control** over your life, and His will is to protect and preserve you. When you speak this scripture over your life, you are declaring that no force—physical or spiritual—can cut short the purpose God has for you.

### Key Scripture: **No Weapon Formed Against You Will Prosper**

> _“No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness is of me, saith the LORD.”_  
> **Isaiah 54:17**

This powerful promise from God assures you that **no weapon**—whether it be sickness, financial attack, spiritual warfare, or any other form of harm—can succeed when you are standing in the **righteousness** of God. This is not just a defensive promise; it’s an **offensive declaration**. God promises that you will have the authority to condemn any evil that rises against you.

### The Power of God's Protection

When you trust in God's Word and stand in His protection, you tap into a **divine shield** that the enemy cannot penetrate. God's Word says that **He is your refuge and fortress**, and when you dwell under His protection, no evil will harm you.

> _“The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?”_  
> **Psalm 27:1**

> _“The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.”_  
> **Proverbs 18:10**

### Key Insight: **Living in Righteousness Brings Protection**

God’s promises of protection are **contingent** upon living in righteousness. It’s important to walk in alignment with God’s will, obeying His Word and following His guidance. When you do, His protection is guaranteed, and you will experience His divine intervention in every area of your life.

> _“The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.”_  
> **Psalm 34:7**

This promise assures you that **God’s angels** are assigned to guard and protect you as you walk in righteousness, and they will **deliver** you from any attack that comes your way.

> _“For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the enemy.”_  
> **Psalm 61:3**

You are safe in the arms of God, and His promises will never fail you.

## The Fatal Flaw: How Believers Unknowingly Grant Access to Spiritual Attacks

Many Christians unknowingly **open doors for spiritual attacks** through **negative confessions** and personal flaws. The words you speak have power, and in the **spiritual realm**, they can serve as **invitation** for the enemy to launch an attack. Negative statements, doubts, and complaints can unknowingly give the enemy legal rights to operate in your life.

### The Power of Negative Words

When you consistently confess **weakness**, **fear**, or **doubt**, you create an opening for the enemy to establish a foothold in your life. For example, phrases such as:
- _"I’m just tired"_
- _"I think I’m losing my mind"_
- _"I don’t think God hears me anymore"_
- _"I don’t see this working"_
- _"I feel confused"_
- _"I’m feeling down"_
- _"I’m feeling sick"_
- _"I’m left with no hope"_

These words, though spoken in frustration or exhaustion, are seen in the **demonic realm** as **permission slips** for the enemy to attack. 

> _"Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof."_  
> **Proverbs 18:21**

### Words as Permission Slips

In the spirit realm, **words** hold immense power. When you say, _"I feel tired,"_ you may be unknowingly giving the enemy the **legal right** to send the **spirit of heaviness**—the very thing Isaiah described as the "failing spirit." (Isaiah 61:3). Your words **invite** spiritual forces into your life, and these forces are quick to act.

> _"A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth: and the recompence of a man's hands shall be rendered unto him."_  
> **Proverbs 12:14**

Your words are **recorded** in the spirit realm, and you are constantly followed by **monitoring spirits** who listen to what you say. When you speak negatively or confess doubt, you unintentionally invite the enemy to take action. **The enemy listens to your words** and uses them to form strategies against you.

### The Spirit of Heaviness

In Isaiah 61:3, we are introduced to the **spirit of heaviness**, which often manifests when negative or complaining words are spoken. This spirit causes people to feel **burdened**, **depressed**, or **weighed down**. When you express frustration through words like, _"I feel tired"_, you open the door for this **spirit of heaviness** to overwhelm your mind and spirit.

> _"To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness..."_  
> **Isaiah 61:3**

### Key Insight: **Words are Seeds**

Your words are like **seeds** that will grow and bear fruit. If you sow words of **doubt**, **fear**, and **negativity**, you will harvest **heaviness**, **confusion**, and **discouragement**. But if you speak **God’s promises**, **faith**, and **hope**, you will sow seeds that lead to victory and strength.

> _"But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved."_  
> **Matthew 24:13**

### Take Authority Over Your Words

You have been given the **authority** to speak life over yourself and your circumstances. **Don’t allow the enemy to use your words against you.** Declare the Word of God, even when circumstances seem overwhelming. Speak the promises of God into your situation.

> _"Let the weak say, I am strong."_  
> **Joel 3:10**

In moments of weakness, declare strength. When you feel sick, declare healing. When you feel overwhelmed, declare peace. Your words shape your reality and have the power to drive back the forces of darkness.

### Guard Your Words

**Guard your words** carefully. They are a weapon—either for life or for destruction. Speak the truth of God's Word over your life, and don’t let negative thoughts or emotions shape your speech. **The enemy is always listening**, and you have the power to reject his plans by speaking the truth of God’s Word.

> _"For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned."_  
> **Matthew 12:37**

### How Negative Words Invite Attacks

Over time, after speaking negative words, you may begin to feel a **heaviness or fogginess** in your mind. Your thoughts become scattered, you might forget things, experience sleep disturbances, or even have hallucinations. Others may start to label you as "mad" or mentally ill. When you visit the doctor, they may diagnose you with **severe depression and psychotic symptoms**, offering medications to treat what they perceive as a chemical imbalance. However, the sickness is not always chemical—it may be **spiritual** in origin.

Without someone interceding on your behalf—such as a spouse, family member, or friend who prays for you—this spiritual attack could lead to feelings of worthlessness or thoughts of self-harm.

This demonstrates that **mental illness**, in many cases, has a spiritual origin. While not all mental health issues are spiritual, those that arise suddenly or without a clear cause, especially following a spiritual trigger, often have demonic roots. In these situations, the cure is not always found in medication but in claiming your authority through the name of Jesus Christ.

Jesus warned that we will give an account for every idle word (Matthew 12:36). The devil does not know your thoughts, but you **reveal your struggles through your words**. When you speak negativity, you invite spiritual forces to attack.

Many Christians today, when faced with difficulty, turn to cursing or complaining. They might say, **"Why is this happening to me?" or "Where was God when this happened?"** Some even doubt God's existence or question His goodness. This type of response greatly pleases the enemy, as it reflects a lack of understanding of the authority God has given you. These Christians are unaware of their spiritual power and how they should respond to adversity.

## Understanding God's Protection in Times of Trouble

Being a believer **does not exempt you from trials or spiritual attacks**. In fact, because you are aligned with God’s purpose, **the enemy will target you**. But take courage—**God has promised His presence and protection** in every season of your life.

As Psalm 91 declares:  
> *“When you call, I will rescue you.”*  

God is your **refuge and shelter**, and when you put your trust in Him, **no evil will ultimately prevail over you**.


### Key Truths to Remember

1. **Attacks will come, but God’s presence is greater.**  
   - Walking through fire? He is with you.  
   - Surrounded by rising waters? They will not overwhelm you.  
   (Isaiah 43:2)

2. **Suffering can be part of God’s refining process.**  
   - Trials are not meant to destroy you but to **shape you into His perfect vessel**.  
   - God uses challenges to remove impurities and make you stronger in faith.

3. **Your trials prepare you for your divine assignment.**  
   - Each of us is created with a **unique purpose**.  
   - Difficult seasons often reveal and confront personal flaws—anger, unforgiveness, bitterness—so that we can grow spiritually.  
   - **God trains and equips you through trials** to fulfill His higher calling.

### Takeaway

- **God’s protection doesn’t mean absence of trouble—it means victory in the midst of it.**  
- Every trial is an opportunity for God to strengthen you, purify you, and align you with His divine purpose.  
- Trust Him as your **refuge, shelter, and ever-present help**.  

> **When you face trouble, remember: God is not just watching—He is with you, working all things together for your good.** (Romans 8:28)
