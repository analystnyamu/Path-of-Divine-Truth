## When Illness is Not Natural: Understanding Spiritual Attacks

When an illness is not natural, doctors often name it after a known disease to make sense of its symptoms. However, some sicknesses are not of this world—they are spiritual attacks. These attacks can come in many forms: a simple incantation, a strand of hair, a name spoken at midnight, or through individuals who work for the enemy and understand spiritual laws. Such illnesses cannot be cured by medicine, for they are not natural.

Though this may be difficult to accept, many of the afflictions we face today are not medical—they are demonic in nature. In this discussion, I will explore the various strategies the enemy uses to target individuals and how you can protect yourself and your family from these attacks. If you or someone you love is battling a persistent, stubborn illness, what you are about to read could be the answer you've been searching for.

What follows is spiritual intelligence that could save a life—perhaps even your own.

## Spiritual Awareness and Protection

If you are a believer in Christ and need awakening to the unseen spiritual war that surrounds you, this message is for you. Those who actively disturb the enemy’s kingdom—through prayer, worship, or living a life that glorifies God—become prime targets. The enemy, who is the god of this world, seeks to hinder those who work diligently for God: those who spread the gospel, deliver the oppressed, and help set captives free.

As a true Christian with a passion for knowing God and doing His work, you are automatically an enemy of the devil. Your actions—whether it’s praying, preaching, or serving others—are a direct threat to his kingdom. As such, you will face attacks.

## Tools the Enemy Uses

The agents of attack do not always need weapons to target you. Sometimes, all they need is your photograph, your name, or even personal items. At times, a small offering of blood is sufficient. These agents use spiritual means such as chanting to summon spirits of infirmity, which can mimic real physical illnesses.

For instance, if the enemy wants to attack you with cancer, the spirit may attach itself to you in such a way that it mirrors every symptom of the disease. The cancer may appear genuine, fooling even the most skilled doctors. You’ll undergo test after test, only to be told you have an aggressive form of cancer—perhaps one that seems to progress at an alarming rate. Within months, weeks, or even days, you may face death, unless you realize the true source of the affliction: a demonic attack.

## The Scriptures on Spiritual Warfare

Psalm 91 speaks of arrows that are thrown during the day and diseases that strike at night. It refers to the terrors of the night—these are spiritual attacks. This kind of warfare cannot be dealt with through general or shallow prayers; it requires prayers that confront the source directly.

If you are a lukewarm Christian, unaware of the spiritual forces at play, you may not realize that you are under attack. Some Christians, even those who are prayerful, may become discouraged and begin questioning God instead of confronting the issue spiritually. The enemy uses fear to paralyze you and make you lose faith, even to the point of giving up.

## The Power You Possess

Many Christians do not fully realize the power they have in Christ because they don’t study the Word of God for themselves. The enemy takes advantage of this ignorance, sowing doubt and fear. Yet, the Scriptures tell us that we have been given authority over the enemy’s power.

If you are a believer and have been baptized, the Bible says that signs and wonders will follow you. You will cast out demons, heal the sick, and the enemy will have no choice but to obey the power of Jesus Christ. As a believer in Christ, you have the authority to use the name of Jesus and His blood to overcome any attack.

When you pray with the Word of God, the enemy cannot withstand you. The Word of God is the sword of the Spirit, and your faith acts as a shield to extinguish the flaming arrows of the enemy. Salvation is the helmet that protects your mind from evil manipulation, while righteousness serves as the breastplate that guards your heart. The work of God you do is like the shoes that protect your feet from being attacked. When you understand the Scriptures and walk in faith, the enemy will flee from you.

## Promises of Protection

God’s Word provides us with promises of protection and provision when we live in righteousness. For example, Psalm 118:17 declares, “I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD.” This powerful scripture can be used against any spiritual attack meant to destroy you. When you stand firm in your faith and trust in God’s Word, no weapon formed against you will prosper.

# The Role of Words in Spiritual Attacks

Many Christians unknowingly open doors for spiritual attacks due to personal flaws and negative confessions. For example, if you consistently confess weakness or speak negatively, this becomes a gateway for the enemy to launch an attack. Statements like "I’m just tired," "I think I’m losing my mind," "I don’t think God hears me anymore," "I don’t see this working," "I feel confused," "I’m feeling down," "I’m feeling sick," or "I’m left with no hope," all give the enemy permission to attack.

In the demonic realm, words like these are seen as permission slips. For example, when you say, "I feel tired," you are giving the enemy the legal right to send the spirit of heaviness immediately, which Isaiah called the "failing spirit" (Isaiah 61:3). Remember, everything you speak is recorded. You are constantly followed by a monitoring spirit that listens to your words. If your words are negative, the enemy will act quickly to implement them.

## How Negative Words Invite Attacks

Over time, after speaking negative words, you may begin to feel a heaviness or fogginess in your mind. Your thoughts become scattered, you might forget things, experience sleep disturbances, or even have hallucinations. Others may start to label you as "mad" or mentally ill. When you visit the doctor, they may diagnose you with severe depression and psychotic symptoms, offering medications to treat what they perceive as a chemical imbalance. However, the sickness is not always chemical—it may be spiritual in origin.

Without someone interceding on your behalf—such as a spouse, family member, or friend who prays for you—this spiritual attack could lead to feelings of worthlessness or thoughts of self-harm.

## Mental Illness as a Spiritual Attack

This demonstrates that mental illness, in many cases, has a spiritual origin. While not all mental health issues are spiritual, those that arise suddenly or without a clear cause, especially following a spiritual trigger, often have demonic roots. In these situations, the cure is not always found in medication but in claiming your authority through the name of Jesus Christ.

Jesus warned that we will give an account for every idle word (Matthew 12:36). The devil does not know your thoughts, but you reveal your struggles through your words. When you speak negativity, you invite spiritual forces to attack.

## Complaints and Curses: How They Empower the Enemy

Some Christians, when faced with difficulty, turn to cursing or complaining. They might say, "Why is this happening to me?" or "Where was God when this happened?" Some even doubt God's existence or question His goodness. This type of response greatly pleases the enemy, as it reflects a lack of understanding of the authority God has given you. These Christians are unaware of their spiritual power and how they should respond to adversity.

## Understanding God's Protection in Times of Trouble

It’s important to understand that being righteous or a believer doesn’t exempt you from spiritual attacks. You are an enemy of the devil, and he will try to hinder your purpose. However, God has promised that He will be with you during your troubles. As Psalm 91 says, “When you call, I will rescue you.” God is your refuge and shelter, and no evil will overcome you or cause harm to you when you trust in Him.

This doesn’t mean that attacks won’t come. Instead, it means that how you respond during times of trouble is key. When you're walking through the fire, He will be with you. When many waters rise against you, they will not overwhelm you. God allows suffering to shape you into the person He has destined you to be. Sometimes, this refining process is part of God’s plan to mold you into a vessel that can fulfill His divine purpose for your life.

## Spiritual Growth Through Trials

God has created each of us with a unique purpose and divine assignment. Our journey often includes various trials and challenges that serve as training grounds to overcome personal flaws—such as anger, unforgiveness, or bitterness. These spiritual weaknesses may be addressed through the suffering we face, and God uses these experiences to develop us for His greater purpose.

# Spiritual Vigilance in Marriage and Relationships

## Newly Married Couples: Fight the Battle Through Prayer

For newly married couples, it’s crucial to understand that your wedding day is not the end of the journey, but the beginning of a spiritual battle. The enemy will often target marriages, sometimes using those who once admired or desired to be with you as a spouse. These individuals can become vessels for the enemy’s schemes, attempting to tear down your marriage.

It's not the time to relax or be complacent—it's time to pray constantly and without ceasing. The problems you experience in your marriage may not always be natural. The enemy may even use close friends or past acquaintances who harbored secret desires to be your spouse. These individuals may engage in occult practices, like womb-blocking rituals, to invoke the spirit of barrenness, which can affect both you and your partner’s reproductive health.

## The Spiritual Root of Physical Issues

Conditions like cramps, fibroids, and cysts may not have a natural cause, especially if you have never used contraceptives or had other obvious triggers for such health issues. In these situations, you may visit multiple doctors and undergo countless fertility tests, but find no answers. Frustration sets in, and you might begin to question why God allows such things to happen to you. In this moment of spiritual confusion, it becomes easy to give up on God and fail to recognize the true source of the attack.

If you don’t have someone interceding for you, like a spouse or close family member who can pray for you, it may lead to feelings of worthlessness, self-doubt, and even thoughts of self-harm. When the enemy attacks, he tries to destroy both your marriage and your faith. Remember, as long as something precious is in your life—whether it’s your marriage, your future children, or your purpose—the enemy will try to intimidate you and make you doubt God.

## Overcoming the Enemy's Attacks

There may be times when God seems silent, as He did when He withdrew from Hezekiah to test his faith. Even though Hezekiah failed, God remains faithful to His promises. If God withdraws at times, it is to test how you will respond. Don’t let frustration lead you to complain or speak negatively about your circumstances. Instead, continue to pray without ceasing. Your prayers will cause the enemy’s rituals and attacks to backfire, and those used by the enemy will begin to realize the power of God’s kingdom.

It’s important to remember that people who persecute you or use dark powers against you are not your enemies. They are human agents manipulated by the enemy. We must pray for their deliverance, not curse them. Jesus modeled this perfectly, loving all people, even those who hated Him. The life of a wicked person is ultimately in their own hands, and when their time comes, they will not escape judgment if they remain unprotected. But for believers, the Lord is our protector, and even in death, it is by His will.

## The Enemy’s Strategy Against Youth and Singles

If you are unmarried, a youth, or a teenager, and you are living a righteous life, walking in the will of God, the enemy will target you with strategies to bring you down. Sometimes, he will introduce someone into your life who seems like a friend or potential romantic partner, even though you know you are not ready for a relationship.

The enemy’s strategy may be to use that person to tempt you into compromising your faith. They may try to pull you into a romantic relationship, leading to soul ties and eventually sexual temptation. The goal is to destroy your purity and distract you from God’s purpose for your life.

## Protecting Your Heart and Spirit

To guard against these attacks, remain vigilant in your spiritual life. Seek the Holy Spirit’s guidance and surrender to His control. Without His strength, you cannot do God’s will. If you are a teenager, do not engage in romantic relationships, as they open doors for temptation. The enemy will try to lure you into a relationship that compromises your values.

If you are looking for a spouse, seek the Holy Spirit’s direction. He will open your spiritual eyes and ears to discern the enemy’s tactics. The devil often sends counterfeit partners, making them appear perfect for you. However, red flags may arise if you are discerning. Pay attention to God’s guidance to avoid being deceived.

## The Danger of Unequally Yoked Relationships

For those seeking a spouse, remember that as a believer, you should not date or marry someone who does not share your faith. The Bible warns us that light and darkness cannot walk together (2 Corinthians 6:14). Don’t make the mistake of thinking you can change someone or convert them after marriage. You will later regret entering into a relationship with someone who does not share your commitment to Christ.

It’s better to wait for the right partner than to settle for someone who compromises your faith. Remember, your bold declaration of faith in Christ places you on the enemy’s radar, and he will do everything in his power to derail you. Be vigilant in prayer, studying the Word of God, and discerning the Spirit’s guidance.

# Spiritual Warfare and Healing: Overcoming Demonic Attacks

## When Attacked Spiritually, Stand Firm in Faith

As a believer, if you experience a spiritual attack and are taken to the hospital, you may receive negative comments or diagnoses that are based on natural or physical causes. For example, if you are attacked by the spirit of paralysis and become numb from the waist down, and doctors say the only solution is a wheelchair, refuse to accept those statements.

Declare healing in the name of Jesus Christ! Stand boldly in your faith, even in the midst of pain, suffering, or trouble. Remember the story of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who, despite being threatened with a fiery furnace, refused to bow to idols. They said, "Even if our God does not save us, we will not bow down."

God’s word says, “Even when you are in trouble, I will be with you, and when you cry to me, I will answer and deliver you” (Psalm 91). Do not pray with complaints or doubts, but speak with authority over your situation, because the power inside you, through Christ, is greater than the one in the world. Say to Jesus, “Even if You do not heal me, I will not serve or trust any other. I will not turn to witchcraft or diviners.”

Remember, faith is your shield. An unshakable faith is like a firewall that the enemy cannot penetrate. Even under pressure or pain, faith combined with the word of God is a mighty weapon. The enemy uses fear as his greatest weapon against Christians, trying to prevent them from praying or standing firm. God’s instructions to Joshua, after a defeat in the battle of Ai, remind us that even in moments of defeat or struggle, God will empower us to rise again.

## Breaking Generational Curses and Demonic Patterns

### The Power of Jesus' Blood

The enemy can also attack through generational curses or patterns that go back up to four generations. If your ancestors opened doors to sin, witchcraft, blood covenants, or immoral acts, these curses can manifest in your life. For example, a blood covenant made long ago for a solution like barrenness may demand the firstborn in each generation, leading to repeated tragedies.

Other examples include inherited illnesses like cancer or diabetes, which some doctors may attribute to genetics, but in reality, it could be a demonic spirit with permission to affect your family line.

Additionally, if your mother faced traumatic events (such as being raped), and these issues were not spiritually dealt with, they can manifest in your life as the same tragedy—such as being attacked in the same way at the same age. These are familiar spirits that work through unresolved issues and open doors from past generations.

### The Power to Break These Patterns

Do not remain silent in the face of these patterns. As a believer, you have the authority to break these generational curses through prayer and fasting and full submission to Christ. Some false prophets may manipulate believers, asking for offerings to break generational curses, but the true solution is complete surrender to Christ. Once you surrender, you gain the power to break these chains, either through your own prayers or with the help of a true man of God.

Remember, the blood of Jesus is more powerful than any generational curse. Jesus' sacrifice has redeemed us from the law (Galatians 3:13). This truth must be understood, because many family illnesses are not caused by genes, but by spiritual forces that need to be dealt with in the name of Jesus.

## How the Enemy Afflicts Through Spiritual Agents

### Warlocks and Human Agents of Darkness

Warlocks and other human agents of darkness are taught that if they cannot physically harm you, they can still attack spiritually. These agents operate like spiritual surgeons, using curses, tokens, and gateways instead of physical tools to afflict people.

The story of Balaam, who was hired to curse the Israelites but was unable to do so, illustrates how these agents operate. Instead of attacking directly, Balaam advised King Balak to make the Israelites sin against God, which led to their downfall.

### How the Enemy Gains Access

1. **Words**: One of the most common entry points for evil spirits is through the victim’s own confession. When someone says, "This headache will kill me" or "This runs in my family; I’m next," they unknowingly issue an invitation for demonic spirits to attack (Proverbs 18:21). Evil spirits monitor your words. If you speak fear or death, they act immediately.

2. **Personal Items**: If an enemy agent can obtain personal items—like your hair, clothing, or even a footprint—they can spiritually "tether" you. These items carry your spiritual code, and if they are placed on an altar or used in a ritual, they can direct spirits to attack you.

3. **Dream Manipulation**: Nighttime is a vulnerable period when many spiritual attacks occur. Dreams of snakes, strange food, or being chased or beaten may not just be dreams—they are spiritual transactions. Diseases can even be injected into you during dreams (Matthew 13:25). This is why it’s vital to cover yourself with prayer before sleep.

4. **Cursed Objects and Gifts**: Objects like gifts, jewelry, or heirlooms may be cursed. Many warlocks anoint these objects with demonic power, and when you bring them into your home, you are unknowingly inviting the associated spirit into your life.

5. **Bloodline Rights and Covenants**: Some families have made spiritual agreements or covenants with deities or altars long ago. These covenants are legally binding in the spirit realm. When this happens, diseases or conditions like cancer or diabetes may not be purely genetic—they can be demonic legal rights inherited through unbroken covenants.

## How to Protect Yourself

The enemy does not fear Christians who shout or speak without understanding. The enemy fears believers who know their power and authority in Christ Jesus. They fear believers who are vigilant in prayer, monitor what they speak, wear, and allow into their hearts and minds.

When you understand how the enemy works, you are no longer his prey. You can confidently declare healing, peace, and victory over your life, family, and health.

# Identifying and Overcoming Demonic Sickness and Disease

One of Satan’s greatest strategies is disguise. If he can make a demonic affliction look like a medical condition, many Christians will never think to fight it spiritually. However, there are clear signs that reveal when a sickness isn’t natural. Once you recognize these signs, you’ll be able to identify spiritual attacks immediately.

## 1. When Doctors Can't Explain It

If you’ve undergone numerous tests, yet doctors can’t find a clear cause or provide a specific treatment, it could be a sign that the issue isn’t physical but spiritual. In Luke 8:43, the woman with the issue of blood spent all her money on doctors, but no one could heal her. Her problem was spiritual, not biological. Jesus was the one who addressed it. When medical professionals cannot find an explanation, it's often a spiritual problem requiring spiritual intervention.

## 2. When It Follows a Spiritual Event or Conflict

Did the sickness appear after a significant spiritual event? For instance, if you gave your life to Christ, joined a new church, or offended someone involved in occult practices, the sickness may be a form of retaliation from the kingdom of darkness. Spiritual attacks often manifest at times of significant spiritual progress or conflict.

## 3. When It Moves, Disappears, or Returns Randomly

Demonic afflictions often have a strange, unpredictable nature. If your sickness shifts locations in your body, disappears without reason, or returns after you stop praying, it is a likely sign that it’s spiritual rather than physical. Demonic sicknesses resist permanent healing unless actively addressed through spiritual means.

## 4. When It Appears in Dreams First

Many demonic illnesses begin in the dream realm. If you dream of being injected, bitten, or attacked, and then wake up with physical symptoms matching those dreams, this is not a mere subconscious issue. It is a spiritual transaction. Jesus warned in Matthew 13:25 that “while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares.” The enemy operates through dreams to plant afflictions, and these can manifest physically when unaddressed.

## 5. When There’s a Family Pattern

If a certain sickness or issue is repeated in every generation of your family—such as fibroids in every woman, sudden deaths at a particular age, or mental health struggles—it is not just genetic. It could be a generational curse. As Lamentations 5:7 says, "Our fathers have sinned and are no more, and we have borne their iniquities." These curses only end when they are broken by the power of Jesus Christ.

## 6. When It Resists Prayer, but Breaks with Fasting and War

Some demonic sicknesses do not respond to casual prayers. However, once you begin fasting and binding spirits in the name of Jesus, the sickness may start to react or diminish. This is a clear sign that the sickness is spiritual. Matthew 17:21 tells us, "This kind goeth not out, but by prayer and fasting." Even a short fast can break long-standing spiritual attacks.

## 7. Anointing Oil and Consecration

One effective way to fight demonic sickness is by using anointing oil. This oil consecrates your body and home, and demons fear it because it represents the Holy Spirit’s seal. Don't fall for manipulative practices—only use genuine anointing oil blessed by your pastor or spiritual father. The Bible instructs in James 5:14 to call for the elders of the church, who should pray over the sick and anoint them with oil. Use the oil to anoint your head, chest, and the entrance of your home, while declaring Psalm 91 as your protection.

## 8. Soak Yourself in the Word of God

The Word of God is both a sword and a shield in spiritual battles. Meditate on healing scriptures daily, speak them aloud, and allow them to become life in your body. The Bible tells us in Psalm 107:20, “He sent His word and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.” Speak these words until they take root in your spirit and soul, rising up against sickness.

## How to Overcome Demonic Sickness

Demonic sicknesses won’t leave quietly. They will resist unless you violently oppose them with the truth of God’s Word and His power. You are not helpless. You are not cursed. In Jesus Christ, you have the authority to drive out these afflictions.

If you or your family members are battling unexplained sickness, like cycles of depression, miscarriages, sudden deaths, or mental torment, do not accept it. Rise up and declare war on the enemy. Plead the blood of Jesus, break the curse, and evict the spirit of affliction.

Remember: Sickness is not always natural, and when it is not, no medication or prescription will help. Only spiritual power can overcome it. And that power is in Jesus Christ—not in religion, rituals, or remedies.

If you have never fully surrendered your life to Jesus, do so now. That is your first and greatest weapon. Without His blood, you’re fighting spiritual forces with no real defense. But with Him, demons bow, altars collapse, and sickness flees.
