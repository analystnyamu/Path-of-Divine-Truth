*"Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart..."*  
— **Jeremiah 1:5**

Every person is born with a unique, divine purpose. However, some are entrusted with particularly powerful gifts—gifts so significant that they pose a direct threat to the kingdom of darkness. These are the **prophets, worshippers, intercessors, teachers, leaders, visionaries, and creatives** who are destined to shift spiritual atmospheres and lead countless souls to Christ. Tragically, many of these individuals are under attack even before they fully realize the magnitude of their calling.

## 🌱 1. The Enemy Knows You're Dangerous—Even Before You Do

From the moment of your conception—and even before—Satan has been aware of the divine potential embedded within you. While he doesn't know everything about you, he can perceive **spiritual assignments, generational anointings, and divine callings placed upon your life**. His tactics are age-old: **to steal, kill, and destroy** (**John 10:10**), and his primary objective is to prevent you from walking into your God-given destiny.

The enemy understands that your **calling, purpose, and spiritual gift** are powerful forces that can shake the very foundations of his kingdom. Even though he cannot fully understand your calling or your future, he knows enough to recognize the **danger you pose to his plans**. That’s why he will do everything within his power to prevent you from walking in your purpose. His attacks often begin long before you even realize the magnitude of your divine assignment.

### **Satan's Strategies: How He Targets You**

**I. Attack Your Identity**  
   The first and most effective way the enemy seeks to derail you is by attacking your **identity**. When you don’t understand who you are in Christ, you become vulnerable to deception. The enemy wants to create doubt, confusion, and insecurity in your life, leading you to question your worth, purpose, and calling. This often happens in the form of negative thoughts, comparisons, and the feeling of inadequacy.  
   - **Scripture Reference**: *"But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light."* — **1 Peter 2:9**  
   - **Scripture Reference**: *"For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother’s womb."* — **Psalm 139:13**

**II. Target Your Mind**  
   The mind is a battlefield, and the enemy knows that controlling your thoughts is one of the most powerful ways to control your destiny. He tries to sow confusion, anxiety, and mental unrest to prevent you from gaining clarity on God’s will for your life. Instability in the mind leads to instability in life choices. The enemy seeks to cloud your judgment, distort your perception, and lead you into confusion, pulling you further from God’s truth.  
   - **Scripture Reference**: *"For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds; Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ."* — **2 Corinthians 10:4-5**  
   - **Scripture Reference**: *"Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind."* — **Romans 12:2**

**III. Disrupt Your Relationships**  
   The enemy knows that we are not meant to walk this journey alone. Relationships are vital for spiritual growth, accountability, and encouragement. By causing division, misunderstanding, and offense in your relationships, Satan tries to isolate you, weakening your resolve and ability to fulfill your calling. Whether it's through family discord, conflicts with friends, or strife in the church, the enemy aims to tear apart the unity God has designed for you.  
   - **Scripture Reference**: *"How good and pleasant it is when God's people live together in unity!"* — **Psalm 133:1**  
   - **Scripture Reference**: *"Do not forsake the gathering of yourselves together..."* — **Hebrews 10:25**

**IV. Undermine Your Gift**  
   Your spiritual gifts are weapons for advancing God’s kingdom. The enemy’s aim is to either **misdirect** or **completely prevent** the use of your gifts. He does this by making you feel unworthy, disqualified, or by planting seeds of fear and doubt about your abilities. He may also attempt to distort your gift, pushing you to misuse it for selfish reasons or causing you to operate outside of God's will.  
   - **Scripture Reference**: *"Do not neglect your gift, which was given you through prophecy when the body of elders laid their hands on you."* — **1 Timothy 4:14**  
   - **Scripture Reference**: *"Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God’s grace in its various forms."* — **1 Peter 4:10**

### **The Enemy's Attack at Every Stage of Life**

What is most tragic about these attacks is that they often begin early—before you have even had the chance to fully recognize your purpose or identity in Christ. Satan does not wait for you to realize your calling. He begins his attacks before you even know who you are, strategically targeting you at every significant stage of your life.

- **As a Child or in the Womb**  
  If the enemy doesn't succeed in destroying you when you're a child—or even while you're still in your mother's womb—he waits for the next opportunity. Many who are called to greatness are attacked before they even know how much potential they hold. The enemy’s tactics at this stage may include violence, abuse, or tragic circumstances designed to destroy the child before they even have a chance to grow.  
  - **Scripture Reference**: *"For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother’s womb."* — **Psalm 139:13**

- **In Your Teenage Years**  
  If the enemy fails to stop you as a child, he will often target you in your **teenage years**, a time of emotional and spiritual vulnerability. This is when he tries to manipulate and confuse you through **sexual sin** and other destructive behaviors that threaten to derail your destiny. Lust, peer pressure, and identity confusion are common weapons the enemy uses during these years to entrap you, causing you to lose sight of your divine purpose.  
  - **Scripture Reference**: *"Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a person commits are outside the body, but whoever sins sexually, sins against their own body."* — **1 Corinthians 6:18**  
  - **Scripture Reference**: *"Do not let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, and in purity."* — **1 Timothy 4:12**

- **In Your Search for a Life Partner**  
  If the enemy does not capture you during these earlier years, he will continue his pursuit in your **adult life**, especially when you are seeking a **spouse**. This is when Satan often tries to lead you astray by presenting the **wrong partner**—someone who may appear good outwardly but is not aligned with God’s will for your life. Choosing the wrong partner can derail your purpose, hinder your growth, and lead to years of unnecessary spiritual battles.  
  - **Scripture Reference**: *"Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness?"* — **2 Corinthians 6:14**  
  - **Scripture Reference**: *"He who finds a wife finds what is good and receives favor from the Lord."* — **Proverbs 18:22**

### **The Tragedy of Early Attacks**

These early attacks are not mere coincidences. They are **strategic plans** designed to prevent you from stepping into your full potential. The enemy knows that if he can capture you early—whether through doubt, sin, confusion, or the wrong relationships—he can hinder your destiny. These attacks are not a sign of failure but a clear indication that you are a threat to the kingdom of darkness.

### **Scripture for Encouragement**

- *"No weapon forged against you will prevail, and you will refute every tongue that accuses you."* — **Isaiah 54:17**
- *"Greater is he who is in you than he who is in the world."* — **1 John 4:4**
- *"The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full."* — **John 10:10**

### **Conclusion**

Remember, the enemy’s attacks are a reflection of the power and potential that lies within you. He targets you because you carry a divine calling that can shake the enemy’s kingdom. Your response to these attacks—through faith, prayer, and a deeper understanding of your identity in Christ—will determine how effectively you walk into your purpose. Don't allow the enemy to deceive you into believing that these attacks are signs of failure; rather, they are proof that you are on the right path and are a force to be reckoned with in God’s Kingdom.

## 🧠 2. Identity is the Foundation of Purpose

*"My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge..."*  
— **Hosea 4:6**

Understanding **who you are** in Christ is essential for walking in the fullness of your purpose. Identity is not just about self-awareness; it is about knowing your **divine origin** and the specific **purpose** God has designed for your life. Many individuals who are gifted in extraordinary ways unknowingly fall into the trap of **misusing their gifts** because they do not fully comprehend their identity in Christ. This lack of understanding opens the door to deception and manipulation by the enemy, leading them to use their gifts for **selfish reasons** rather than for the **advancement of God’s Kingdom**.

In the world, these gifts may be referred to as "talents" or "abilities," but in the Kingdom of God, they are **divine callings**—spiritual tools crafted by God Himself, meant to **serve His purposes** and bring glory to Him. If you fail to grasp the **source** of your gift, you risk using it for your own benefit—whether for **fame**, **pride**, **manipulation**, or even **rebellion**. This misalignment leads to **deception**, **confusion**, and the loss of **spiritual alignment**.

### **The Danger of Misunderstanding Your Identity and Gift**

When you don’t know who you are in Christ, you are vulnerable to the enemy's subtle tactics of deception. The enemy doesn’t want you to understand that your gift was **given to you by God** for a specific purpose. Instead, he will attempt to distort your understanding, causing you to misuse your gift for **worldly gain** or **prideful ambitions**.

For example, if you have a gift of leadership or influence, without a clear understanding of your identity in Christ, you may begin to use it to manipulate others, promote your own glory, or build a following based on your **personal desires** rather than on God’s will. Similarly, if you have the gift of teaching or preaching, you may be tempted to **elevate your own wisdom** above God's Word, leading others astray instead of guiding them in truth.

- **Scripture Reference**: *"For the gifts and calling of God are irrevocable."* — **Romans 11:29**  
- **Scripture Reference**: *"Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows."* — **Galatians 6:7**

### **The Prophetic Gift: A Powerful Tool for Truth or Deception**

For those with the **gift of prophecy**, understanding your identity in Christ is even more critical. The **prophetic gift** is a powerful tool designed to **bring truth**, **revelation**, and **direction**. However, when this gift is **misunderstood** or **misused**, it can easily be turned into a tool of **manipulation**, **fear**, or **falsehood**. The enemy delights in distorting prophetic gifts, turning them into instruments of harm, confusion, and division within the body of Christ.

The **true prophetic voice** is meant to align with **God’s Word**, speak life, and point people back to the truth of God's will. But if a prophet is not secure in their identity in Christ, they may fall prey to **pride**, **self-glorification**, or the temptation to speak on their own behalf rather than being led by the **Holy Spirit**. This can cause spiritual damage to others and hinder the fulfillment of God's plans.

- **Scripture Reference**: *"If anyone speaks, they should do so as one who speaks the very words of God."* — **1 Peter 4:11**  
- **Scripture Reference**: *"The one who prophesies speaks to people for their strengthening, encouraging and comfort."* — **1 Corinthians 14:3**

### **Paul’s Emphasis on Love as the Foundation of Prophecy**

The Apostle Paul, in **1 Corinthians 13**, makes it clear that **love** is the foundation for all spiritual gifts. Without love, even the most powerful gifts—like prophecy—are **meaningless**. Paul writes:

*"If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal."* — **1 Corinthians 13:1**

This passage shows that the **gift of prophecy** and any other spiritual gift must be **operated in love** in order to be effective and aligned with God’s will. Without love, the gifts become **empty** and can cause harm instead of bringing about God’s intended purpose.

- **Scripture Reference**: *"Follow the way of love and eagerly desire gifts of the Spirit, especially prophecy."* — **1 Corinthians 14:1**

### **The Fruit of the Spirit Must Accompany the Gifts**

In addition to love, Paul emphasizes the need for the **fruits of the Spirit** to accompany the use of spiritual gifts. **Galatians 5:22-23** speaks about the fruit of the Spirit, which includes love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. These **fruits** are evidence that the Holy Spirit is working in and through you, ensuring that your gifts are being used rightly.

When you are operating in **love** and the **fruit of the Spirit**, your gifts will be in alignment with God’s will. For example, if you have the gift of prophecy, and you are walking in **love** and **gentleness**, your prophetic words will not come from a place of condemnation or manipulation but from a heart of compassion, truth, and encouragement.

- **Scripture Reference**: *"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control."* — **Galatians 5:22-23**
- **Scripture Reference**: *"Let love be your highest goal, but also desire the special abilities the Spirit gives, especially the ability to prophesy."* — **1 Corinthians 14:1 (NLT)**

### **Misalignment Leads to Destruction**

Misunderstanding your **identity** in Christ is one of the **greatest pitfalls** that a believer can fall into. When your identity is **rooted in Christ**, your gifts are protected, and you are able to use them in alignment with God's will. However, when your identity is **rooted in the world**, your gifts become vulnerable to misuse, leading to confusion, frustration, and spiritual emptiness.

- **Scripture Reference**: *"Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!"* — **2 Corinthians 5:17**  
- **Scripture Reference**: *"But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light."* — **1 Peter 2:9**

### **Protecting Your Identity in Christ**

The key to fulfilling your divine calling is to remain **secure in your identity** in Christ. **Your identity is your foundation**, and your gifts are meant to flow from that identity. If you are not grounded in Christ, the enemy will attempt to sow seeds of **doubt**, **pride**, and **misdirection**, causing you to step outside of God's will. However, when you understand that your gifts are not for your own gain but for God's **Kingdom purpose**, you will be able to use them with integrity and purity.

- **Scripture Reference**: *"Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will."* — **Romans 12:2**  
- **Scripture Reference**: *"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control."* — **Galatians 5:22-23**

### **Conclusion: Identity Guards Your Purpose**

Understanding your identity in Christ is not just a matter of self-awareness; it is **the foundation** for discovering and walking in your **purpose**. The enemy knows that if he can distort your identity, he can steer you away from your divine calling. But when you **know who you are in Christ**, you will be able to use your gifts for the glory of God and the advancement of His Kingdom.

Your **identity** and **purpose** are intertwined—**when you know who you are, you will know what you are called to do**. Protect your identity in Christ, and you will protect your gifts from misuse. In doing so, you will walk in alignment with God’s perfect will, fulfilling the divine purpose He has set before you.

## 🎯 3. Seek God to Discover Who You Truly Are

*"Call to me and I will answer you and tell you great and unsearchable things you do not know."*  
— **Jeremiah 33:3**

**True identity** is not something that can be fully discovered through self-exploration or worldly wisdom. It is a **revelation** that only comes from the One who created you. This process is not about **self-discovery**, but rather about **God-discovery**. The more you seek God with all your heart, the more He will reveal not only who you truly are but also the **gifts** He has entrusted to you and, more importantly, the **purpose** behind those gifts.

### **God’s Revelation: The Key to True Identity**

**Jeremiah 29:13** promises, *"You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart."* This verse makes it clear that God is the ultimate source of **true revelation**. To truly understand who you are, you must first seek God with sincerity and a **humble heart**. He is the Creator, and only in knowing Him can you fully comprehend **who you are** and **why you are here**. 

This process of **discovery** is not superficial or self-centered; it is deeply spiritual. As you press into God’s presence, He will begin to show you the **purpose** He has written over your life—the **destiny** He has preordained for you from the beginning of time.

- **Scripture Reference**: *"You created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother’s womb."* — **Psalm 139:13**  
- **Scripture Reference**: *"Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you, before you were born, I set you apart."* — **Jeremiah 1:5**

### **A Journey of Divine Revelation**

The **journey** of discovering your true identity is one that unfolds as you grow closer to God. It is not merely a process of self-awareness, but rather a deeper intimacy with the Creator. God desires to reveal **great and unsearchable things** to you—things that go far beyond what you can understand with your natural mind. These are spiritual truths that only He can reveal.

- **Scripture Reference**: *"But the Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God’s children."* — **Romans 8:16**  
- **Scripture Reference**: *"The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God."* — **1 Corinthians 2:10**

When you seek God, He begins to open your **spiritual eyes** to see your gifts in a new light. You begin to understand that your **gifts** are not just for personal enjoyment or worldly success but for fulfilling a **divine calling**. You will start to recognize that these gifts are meant to serve **God’s greater purpose** for your life and His Kingdom.

### **The Danger of Misusing Your Gifts Without God’s Revelation**

For those with the **gift of prophecy**, seeking God’s guidance is especially crucial. The prophetic gift is a powerful and sacred tool meant to bring truth, direction, and insight, but without God’s continual **revelation**, this gift can easily be misused. Prophetic words that come from our own understanding or desires can become **corrupted**, **misguided**, and potentially harmful. This is why Paul writes in **1 Corinthians 14:3**, *"But the one who prophesies speaks to people for their strengthening, encouraging and comfort."*

God’s revelation is the **guardrail** that ensures prophetic words remain pure, aligned with His will, and beneficial to others. Without this revelation, prophetic gifts can quickly shift from being tools of **life** to instruments of **manipulation** or **deception**. Prophets must seek God continually to ensure their words bring about His purposes, not their own agenda.

- **Scripture Reference**: *"Do not despise prophecies, but test everything; hold fast what is good."* — **1 Thessalonians 5:20-21**  
- **Scripture Reference**: *"For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost."* — **2 Peter 1:21**

### **The Role of the Holy Spirit in Revealing Identity**

One of the greatest blessings for believers is the **Holy Spirit**, who serves as our **comforter**, **teacher**, and **guide**. It is through the Holy Spirit that we come to a deeper understanding of our true identity. The **Spirit of God** searches the depths of God’s will and reveals it to us. As we cultivate a relationship with the Holy Spirit, He will illuminate the **truth** of who we are in Christ.

- **Scripture Reference**: *"The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God’s children."* — **Romans 8:16**  
- **Scripture Reference**: *"When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth."* — **John 16:13**

### **Seeking God With All Your Heart**

True identity and purpose are only **fully revealed** through a deep, sincere relationship with God. As you seek Him with **all your heart**, He will answer you. Not just with surface-level answers, but with **revelation** that leads to transformation. The more you spend time in His presence, the more you begin to see the **gifts** and **callings** He has placed within you, and you begin to understand the **divine purpose** behind them.

- **Scripture Reference**: *"You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart."* — **Jeremiah 29:13**  
- **Scripture Reference**: *"The Lord is near to all who call on him, to all who call on him in truth."* — **Psalm 145:18**

### **In Conclusion: The Source of All Understanding**

Your **identity** and **purpose** are inseparable from your **relationship with God**. As you grow closer to Him, He will reveal to you the true extent of the **gifts** He has placed within you and why He has entrusted you with them. This is not a journey of **self-discovery**, but one of **God-discovery**. The more you seek Him, the clearer your identity and purpose will become.

Remember, **God is the Creator** who formed you with a unique design, and only by seeking Him can you fully understand the divine calling upon your life. Through **revelation** from the Holy Spirit, you will be equipped to walk confidently in the gifts He has given you, fulfilling the purpose He has set before you.

- **Scripture Reference**: *"For it is God who works in you to will and to act in order to fulfill his good purpose."* — **Philippians 2:13**

## 🕊️ 4. You Need Spiritual Covering and Mentorship

*"Obey your spiritual leaders and do what they say. Their work is to watch over your souls..."*  
— **Hebrews 13:17**

No matter how gifted you are, **God never intended for you to walk this journey alone**. The road to fulfilling your divine calling is not one of isolation but one of **community, guidance**, and **accountability**. **Spiritual covering** and **mentorship** are essential for maintaining spiritual health, growth, and alignment with God’s purpose for your life. God places spiritual leaders in our lives who are **anointed and equipped** to nurture and guide us in the way of truth.

### **The Need for Spiritual Covering**

The concept of **spiritual covering** is deeply rooted in Scripture. Just as a physical body needs protection from the elements, your spirit needs to be covered and guarded. This covering is not just about authority, but about **protection** and **guidance**. A mentor or spiritual leader acts as a spiritual guardian, watching over your **soul** and ensuring that you are walking in alignment with God’s will.

- **Scripture Reference**: *"But the one who is joined to the Lord is one spirit with him."* — **1 Corinthians 6:17**  
- **Scripture Reference**: *"The Lord will watch over your coming and going both now and forevermore."* — **Psalm 121:8**

Spiritual covering protects you from **spiritual deception**, **false teachings**, and **emotional instability**. It also keeps you **accountable**—ensuring that your spiritual journey remains anchored in **truth** and not swayed by personal desires or external influences. Just as a soldier needs a commanding officer to guide and instruct, so too does every believer need spiritual leadership to help them stay on track.

### **Mentorship: The Key to Growing in Your Gifts**

Mentorship is not just about receiving knowledge but about **growing** in wisdom and **spiritual maturity**. A mentor is someone who walks alongside you, providing guidance, wisdom, and correction when necessary. They help nurture your **gifts** and help you navigate the **dangers** and **pitfalls** that may arise as you grow in your calling. 

For those with the **prophetic gift**, mentorship is particularly important. **Prophecy** is a weighty and powerful gift, one that can either build up or tear down, depending on how it is used. Without proper guidance, prophetic individuals can become vulnerable to **pride**, **misguided motivations**, or even **deception**. A seasoned mentor helps you **discern the voice of God**, ensure that your words align with His heart, and remain **humble** in the face of such an anointed responsibility.

- **Scripture Reference**: *"Where there is no guidance, a people falls, but in an abundance of counselors there is safety."* — **Proverbs 11:14**  
- **Scripture Reference**: *"Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers, they succeed."* — **Proverbs 15:22**

A mentor will also help you understand **timing**—when to speak and when to remain silent. They will encourage you to **seek God’s heart** first, to ensure that your prophetic words are birthed from His will, not your own emotional desires or personal agendas.

### **The Dangers of Lack of Spiritual Covering**

When you are **uncovered**, you risk falling prey to various spiritual attacks or traps set by the enemy. **Pride**, **confusion**, and **burnout** are common dangers for those who do not have spiritual covering or mentorship. Pride can cause you to believe that you no longer need guidance, that you have arrived at a place where you no longer need to submit to authority. Confusion can arise when there is no one to help you sift through the **competing voices** you may hear, especially in a world full of distractions. Without proper mentorship, you may also fall into **burnout**, where you begin to feel disconnected from God’s purpose and energy is drained without the needed spiritual replenishment.

Without accountability, a gifted individual can become spiritually **misaligned**, focusing on **personal glory** instead of God’s will. The **enemy** often uses this to prevent believers from walking in their full potential, creating cracks in their spiritual armor that lead to spiritual **failure** or **disqualification**.

- **Scripture Reference**: *"Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall."* — **Proverbs 16:18**  
- **Scripture Reference**: *"Two are better than one...If either of them falls down, one can help the other up."* — **Ecclesiastes 4:9-10**

### **Spiritual Accountability: Refining and Aligning Your Gifts**

**Accountability** is crucial for maintaining spiritual integrity. When you are under the right spiritual covering, your gifts are **refined**, **shaped**, and **aligned** with God’s truth. Spiritual leaders and mentors help you **discern** when you’re veering off course, guiding you back to God’s will. They also help keep you grounded, reminding you that **humility**, **obedience**, and **submission** to God’s will are foundational to walking in the fullness of your gifts.

When you are in a healthy relationship with your mentor or spiritual leader, your gift will **flourish**, becoming **more effective** and **more powerful**. Through their counsel and correction, you will grow in **wisdom**, **maturity**, and **spiritual depth**, ensuring that your gift remains a tool for God’s Kingdom and not for personal gain or self-exaltation.

- **Scripture Reference**: *"As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another."* — **Proverbs 27:17**  
- **Scripture Reference**: *"Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ."* — **Ephesians 5:21**

### **Conclusion: The Power of Spiritual Covering and Mentorship**

In conclusion, **spiritual covering** and **mentorship** are vital for the proper development and protection of your spiritual gifts. **No matter how anointed you are**, you cannot fulfill your calling in isolation. You need spiritual leaders to provide guidance, protect your soul, and keep you accountable to the truth of God’s Word. For those with the **prophetic gift**, mentorship is especially important, ensuring that your words and actions are in alignment with God’s will.

As you submit to **godly authority** and remain in **fellowship** with other believers, your gifts will be refined, strengthened, and aligned with God’s divine purpose for your life.

- **Scripture Reference**: *"Let the wise listen and add to their learning, and let the discerning get guidance."* — **Proverbs 1:5**  
- **Scripture Reference**: *"Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls, as those who will have to give an account."* — **Hebrews 13:17**

## 🛡️ 5. Stay Humble, Stay Holy, Stay Hidden in God

*"God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble."*  
— **James 4:6**  
*"Put on love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony."*  
— **Colossians 3:14**

Your **gift** is powerful, and it may open doors for opportunities, recognition, and influence, but it is your **character** that will determine whether you will remain in those places. As much as we desire to walk in our divine calling, the enemy is always on the lookout for any signs of **pride**, **rebellion**, or **bitterness**, because these emotions can open doors to **deception**, **spiritual attacks**, and even cause us to fall from grace (**Ephesians 4:27**). Therefore, it’s essential to walk in humility, purity, and love, as they serve as shields protecting you from the enemy’s snares.

### **The Power of Humility**

Humility is not just a trait but a lifestyle. Humility is the cornerstone of true spiritual authority, especially for those called to **prophetic ministry**. Prophecy is never about **self-glorification**, seeking attention, or manipulating others. It is about **delivering God's truth** with grace and love. When you are humble, you are positioned to be a **vessel** through which the Holy Spirit flows freely. Humility ensures that the **anointing** remains pure and undiluted, allowing God's will to be accomplished through you, rather than your own desires.

- **Scripture Reference**: *"Humble yourselves before the Lord, and He will lift you up."* — **James 4:10**  
- **Scripture Reference**: *"Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted."* — **Matthew 23:12**

Humility positions you in a place of **grace**. **God’s grace** is not only unmerited favor, but also the strength and empowerment you need to fulfill your divine calling. **Pride** opens doors to the enemy, inviting **spiritual warfare** and destruction. However, walking in humility shields you from the enemy's attacks, keeping you aligned with God’s purpose.

- **Scripture Reference**: *"Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall."* — **Proverbs 16:18**  
- **Scripture Reference**: *"God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble."* — **James 4:6**

### **Purity and Love as a Protection**

**Purity** is not just about abstaining from sin, but about staying pure in **intent**, **heart**, and **actions**. A pure heart is one that seeks God's glory above all else. When you keep your heart **clean**, it becomes a **vessel** through which God can work without hindrance. **Love** is the most powerful force that binds everything together, and when your gifts are operated through love, they become transformative, uplifting, and effective.

- **Scripture Reference**: *"Let all that you do be done in love."* — **1 Corinthians 16:14**  
- **Scripture Reference**: *"Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins."* — **1 Peter 4:8**

Love binds everything in **perfect harmony**. It is the language of the Kingdom, the foundation of all gifts, and the key to walking in divine alignment with God. Prophecy, when used with love, brings healing, restoration, and direction. **Without love**, it becomes a tool for self-promotion and manipulation. **Purity** and **love** are the protective barriers that ensure the enemy cannot manipulate or distort your gift.

### **Stay Hidden in God**

**Staying hidden in God** is about constantly submitting your life and your gifts to Him. It means living a life of **surrender** and trusting that **He is the one who promotes, elevates, and uses your gifts** according to His plan. The moment you begin to rely on your own strength, understanding, or recognition, you are stepping out of the **protection** and **anointing** of God.

In our world, it is easy to seek validation, recognition, and affirmation from others. But when you **stay hidden in God**, you choose to seek His affirmation above all else. You understand that your gift is **not yours** but **His**, and that it is through **His grace** that you are able to operate in it.

- **Scripture Reference**: *"Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me."* — **Luke 9:23**

Staying hidden in God means **maintaining humility**, walking in **obedience**, and surrendering your will to His. When you do so, your **gift** remains **protected**, **refined**, and **aligned** with God’s will for your life. You will not fall prey to the **temptation of fame** or **recognition**, but instead, you will use your gift to bring **glory to God** and advance His Kingdom.

### **Conclusion: Walking in Humility, Purity, and Love**

To walk in your divine calling and use your gifts for God's glory, you must **stay humble**, **stay holy**, and **stay hidden in God**. **Humility** protects your heart from pride and spiritual deception. **Purity** ensures your heart remains clean and aligned with God's purposes. **Love** binds everything together and ensures that your actions reflect God’s heart.

## ✨ Final Word

*"For we are God’s masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so we can do the good things He planned for us long ago."*  
— **Ephesians 2:10**

You were born with a **divine gift**, designed by God, not for personal fame, wealth, or applause, but to **bring glory to Him**. The enemy knows that when you walk in truth, grounded in God's purpose, the impact you will have is profound.

### **Stewardship of Your Prophetic Gift**

For those with the **prophetic gift**, this stewardship is particularly significant.

- **Scripture Reference**: *"But the one who prophesies speaks to people for their strengthening, encouraging, and comfort."* — **1 Corinthians 14:3**

### **Obedience and Surrender**

Your gift, though powerful, is only truly effective when you **surrender** it to God daily. It is His gift, and it must be used according to His purposes. **Obedience** to God's will is key to unlocking the full potential of your gift. When you remain **obedient**, God can trust you with more. **Humility** is also essential because it keeps you from seeking your own glory and allows the Spirit to flow freely through you.

- **Scripture Reference**: *"To obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed is better than the fat of rams."* — **1 Samuel 15:22**  
- **Scripture Reference**: *"Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much..."* — **Luke 16:10**

### **Faithfulness Brings Fruit**

Stay true to His Word, and watch as He uses your gift to impact the world in ways that are beyond your imagination.

- **Scripture Reference**: *"Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things."* — **Matthew 25:21**

### **Conclusion**
