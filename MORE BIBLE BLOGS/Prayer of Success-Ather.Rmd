# Dear Ather,

Warm greetings in the **precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ**.

Congratulations on completing your **KCSE examinations**! As *Mr. and Mrs. Martin*, we are truly proud of you, and we thank God for carrying you this far. Completing this milestone is a testimony of God’s grace, and we believe He has prepared a **bright and meaningful future** for you.

Ather, as you enter a new season of life, remember that **focus**, **discipline**, and **determination** are pillars that will carry you far. You are stepping into a world that is increasingly dark and morally confused. Many young people today are trapped in temptations brought through the internet—**sexual immorality**, **harmful content**, **peer influence**, and habits that weaken character and open doors to spiritual attacks. These influences look attractive, but they are designed by the enemy to **destroy destinies**.

But when a young man walks in the **fear of God**, no trap of the enemy can swallow his future. **Christ gives strength** where the world gives pressure, and His presence shields you from dangers that many fall into.

## **The Power of God’s Word**

One of the greatest weapons God has given you is **His Word**.

A young man who studies the Scriptures daily becomes **spiritually strong**, **wise**, and **disciplined**. The Word of God **cleanses the mind**, **sharpens discernment**, and exposes every lie of the enemy. When the Word guides your steps, you will naturally shun evil and walk in victory.

> “Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked…
> But his delight is in the law of the LORD…
> He will be like a tree planted by streams of water… whatever he does prospers.”
> — *Psalm 1:1–3*

> “How can a young man keep his way pure?
> By guarding it according to Your Word.”
> — *Psalm 119:9*

> “Your word have I hidden in my heart,
> that I might not sin against You.”
> — *Psalm 119:11*

Ather, when you build your life on the **Word of God**, you will have **good success** and **prosper** in all you do, because Scripture will guide your decisions and protect your heart from deception. God told Joshua the same:

> “This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth;
> meditate on it day and night…
> for then you will make your way prosperous and have good success.”
> — *Joshua 1:8*

## **Walking With Christ**

Never forget this spiritual truth: **life outside Christ is unprotected**.  
Without His covering, people become vulnerable to destruction, spiritual attacks, and wasted destinies. But those who walk with **Jesus** receive His **protection**, **guidance**, and **preservation**.

> “If you make the **LORD** your refuge,  
> if you make the Most High your shelter,  
> **no evil will conquer you; no plague will come near your dwelling.**”  
> — *Psalm 91:9–10*

This is God’s divine promise of protection—when you stay close to Him, no evil scheme, no temptation, and no hidden danger can prevail over your life.

God also warns us in Scripture about the danger of walking in wickedness:

> “**The wicked die before their time.**”  
> — *Job 36* (a reminder that those who reject God’s ways often shorten their own days)

Ather, when you choose to **walk with Christ**, you choose **life**, **purpose**, and **divine covering**. He will go before you, shield you, and guide your steps into a future full of **peace** and **success**.

## **Your Role as the Firstborn**

Remember the special place God has given you as the **firstborn**.
Your younger siblings will watch your steps, and your decisions will guide theirs. God often uses firstborns as **pillars in their families**—those who break limits, open new doors, and lead others toward greatness. When you walk wisely, your entire household benefits.

## **Build Your Own Life**

One more important truth: **do not build your future around what your parents have**.

What they have materially is temporary. But what they have given you—
**education**, **discipline**, **counsel**, and the **fear of God**—
is more valuable than any inheritance.

Build your own life with **hard work**, **integrity**, and **reverence for God**.
When you do this, **the Lord Himself will bless the work of your hands** and establish you in due time.

> “Set an example for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith and in purity.”
> — *1 Timothy 4:12*

---

We believe in you, and we pray that **God will bless your journey ahead**.
May He give you **success** in your further education and every endeavor you pursue.
Stay focused, work hard, honor God, and you will see **His goodness** in all your ways.

With prayers and blessings,
**Mr. & Mrs. Martin**
