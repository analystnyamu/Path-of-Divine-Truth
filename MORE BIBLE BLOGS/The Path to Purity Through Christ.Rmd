Have you ever asked yourself, *Why am I here?* or *What is my true purpose?* From the very beginning, God created us with a profound calling: **to live a life of purity**, reflecting His **holiness** and **love**. But how can we return to this pure life when we are surrounded by temptation, brokenness, and imperfection? The answer is found in **Jesus Christ**—the only path that leads to restoring the holiness we were created to embody.

Let this be your first step on a transformative journey—a journey that leads to **freedom**, **inner peace**, and **spiritual power**. Embrace the power of purity through Christ and unlock the life God intended for you.

### The Purpose of Our Creation

God created us with a specific purpose: **to live in purity**, reflecting His **holiness** and **righteousness**. From the very beginning, when He formed **Adam and Eve**, God declared His creation to be "**very good**" (**Genesis 1:31**). Humanity was designed to live in perfect harmony with God, free from the stain of sin and impurity.

However, through the **fall of man**, **sin entered the world** and corrupted that purity. But God, in His **mercy and grace**, has provided a way for us to be restored to the life He originally intended—a life of **holiness** and **purity** through **Jesus Christ**.

### Embrace Your Calling

As you embark on this journey of **spiritual restoration**, remember: God created you to reflect His **holiness**. You were made to live free of impurity and sin. Through **Jesus Christ**, we can once again walk the path of purity and holiness, living the life we were meant to live.

---

**Embrace this calling**, for it is through Christ that we find true freedom, peace, and power. The way back to purity is not through our own efforts but through accepting the **grace** and **sacrifice** that Jesus made for us. Let Him lead you back to the **life of purity** that God intended from the beginning.


## The Call to Holiness and Purity

Throughout the Bible, we see that God calls His people to live lives of **purity** and **holiness**. Holiness is not merely about external actions; it is a reflection of **God's nature**, and it must permeate every aspect of our lives—our thoughts, words, and deeds.

In **Leviticus 11:44**, God commands:
> “For I am the LORD your God. **Consecrate yourselves therefore, and be holy**, for **I am holy**.”

This call is not just a command for the **Israelites** but for all believers. God desires His people to be **set apart**, to reflect His nature, and to live lives that are pleasing to Him. **Peter** echoes this call in **1 Peter 1:15-16**:
> "But as He who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct, because it is written, '**Be holy, for I am holy**.'"

**Holiness** is not optional; it is an essential part of the Christian life, an invitation to live in alignment with God’s will.

## The Impurity of the Human Heart

While God created us to live pure lives, the reality is that **all of us are born with impure hearts**. We are all born sinners. **Romans 3:23** reminds us:
> "for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."

Impurity and sin are not just actions; they are part of our **fallen nature**. The prophet **Jeremiah** writes:
> "**The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately sick; who can understand it?**" (**Jeremiah 17:9**).

Sin is not merely an **external problem**; it originates in the heart and affects every part of our being.

**Jesus** Himself emphasized that sin begins in the heart. In **Matthew 15:18-19**, He said:
> "But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this defiles a person. For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false witness, slander."

Therefore, true **purity** cannot come from mere **external observance of laws** or rituals. It must come from a **transformed heart**—a heart made pure through **faith in Christ**.

## The Only Way to Purity: Jesus Christ

For us to live the pure and holy lives God intended, we must be **reconciled to God**, and that reconciliation can only come through **Jesus Christ**. Christ is the only **mediator** between humanity and God. **1 Timothy 2:5** declares:
> "For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man **Christ Jesus**."

He is the only way to restore our relationship with God. **Jesus** Himself said in **John 14:6**:
> "I am the way, and the truth, and the life. **No one comes to the Father except through Me**."

It is only through **Jesus** that we can approach God the Father and receive the **purity** He desires for us. Christ is the **source of our holiness** and purity, and He offers us the **gift of salvation** through His life, death, and resurrection.

## The Need for Confession and Faith in Christ

Because we are all born sinners, living impure lives, the only way to become pure is by accepting **Jesus Christ** as our Savior. This is not a matter of **self-improvement** or trying harder to be good; it is a matter of accepting the fact that we cannot be pure on our own. We must acknowledge our sin, **confess** it to God, and believe that **Jesus Christ** died for our sins, taking the penalty for them upon Himself. **Romans 10:9** says:
> "**If you declare with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.**"

This is the only way to be made pure—through **faith in Christ**.

The apostle **John** writes in **1 John 1:9**:
> "If we confess our sins, **He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins** and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."

When we confess our sins and place our **faith in Christ**, God purifies us through the **blood of Jesus**. We are **forgiven** and made **new**, and the **Holy Spirit** empowers us to live a life that honors God.

## The Holy Spirit: The Source of Purity

Once we accept Christ, the **Holy Spirit** comes to live within us, guiding us into all truth and empowering us to live pure lives. The **Spirit** convicts us of sin, comforts us, and enables us to bear the **fruit of the Spirit**, which includes **love**, **joy**, **peace**, **kindness**, and **self-control** (**Galatians 5:22-23**). It is the **Holy Spirit** who transforms us from the inside out, producing the **purity** that God desires.

In **John 16:13**, Jesus promised that the **Holy Spirit** would guide us into all truth:
> "When the Spirit of truth comes, **He will guide you into all the truth**."

The **Holy Spirit** is essential in our pursuit of **holiness**, helping us to live according to God’s will and to overcome the temptations and impurities of the world.

## The Way to Escape the Schemes of the Enemy

The enemy, **Satan**, works tirelessly to lead people away from God’s truth. As **2 Corinthians 4:4** says:
> "The **god of this age** has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel that displays the glory of Christ, who is the image of God."

**Satan** deceives people, causing them to worship the **creation** rather than the **Creator**. This is why it is so important to seek **God** with all our hearts, for He promises to be found by those who earnestly seek Him (**Jeremiah 29:13**). The **truth of the gospel**, the **knowledge of Christ**, and the guidance of the **Holy Spirit** are what will protect us from the enemy’s schemes.

## Christ’s Call to Purity

**Jesus’** invitation to us is clear: He is the **way to purity**, the **way to eternal life**, and the **way to reconciliation** with the Father. He calls us to deny ourselves, take up our cross, and follow Him (**Matthew 16:24**). Through Him, we are made pure, and through His grace, we can live lives that reflect His holiness.

In **Matthew 7:13-14**, **Jesus** warns that the way to eternal life is **narrow**, and only a few find it. This narrow way is only found through Him, the **Savior of the world**. We must recognize our need for Him and accept His offer of salvation.

## Conclusion

**God did not create us to live impure lives**. His plan for humanity from the beginning was for us to reflect His **holiness** and live in **purity**. However, sin has corrupted humanity, and the only way to restore purity is through **faith in Jesus Christ**. He is the only **mediator** between God and man, the **way, the truth, and the life**. Through **confession** and belief in **Christ**, we are made pure, and the **Holy Spirit** empowers us to live holy lives.

No matter where you are or what your background is, if you seek **God** with a sincere heart, He will reveal Himself to you and guide you into all truth. Let us turn to **Jesus**, the only way to be saved, and allow His purity to transform our lives. Through Him, we can escape the schemes of the enemy and live the holy and pure life **God intended for us**.
