Many people ask, “If God is good, why does He allow people to suffer, die young, or experience terrible things like molestation without intervening?”

The answer begins with God’s original design: He created mankind in His own image to live with Him, fear Him, and obey Him (Genesis 1:27; Ecclesiastes 12:13). However, through deception, Satan led man into sin, and sin entered the world (Romans 5:12). This sin corrupted the world, bringing death, suffering, and evil.

God, in His great mercy, made a way to redeem mankind. Animal sacrifices could not fully take away sin (Hebrews 10:4), so God sent His Son, Jesus Christ, as the perfect sacrifice. Whoever believes in Him will not only enjoy peace and purpose in this life but also inherit eternal life (John 3:16).

## **The Blessings of Living a Godly Life**

God promises abundant blessings for those who fear Him and live righteously. Living according to His will does not only lead to eternal rewards but also brings powerful, practical blessings in this life.

### **Protection**
God’s protection is one of the greatest assurances He gives to those who honor and fear Him. This protection goes beyond physical safety; it encompasses emotional, spiritual, and psychological security.  
- **“The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear Him, and He delivers them”** (Psalm 34:7).  
  God promises to provide heavenly protection, sending His angels to guard and guide His people. When you walk in reverence and obedience to God, you are shielded from harm, whether visible or invisible. **More Scriptures**:
  
- Psalm 91:1–2: “Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of the Lord, ‘He is my refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust.’”
- Psalm 34:7: “The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear Him, and He delivers them.”
- Proverbs 18:10: “The name of the Lord is a strong tower; the righteous run to it and are safe.”
- Isaiah 54:17: “No weapon formed against you shall prosper…”
- Job 1:10: “Have You not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has?”

### **Provision**
God is the ultimate Provider, and His provision is not limited to material needs. He promises that He will meet the needs of those who place their trust in Him and follow His ways.  
- **“The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing”** (Psalm 23:1).  
  In Psalm 23, David declares that with God as our Shepherd, we shall never be in want. God supplies everything His children need—food, shelter, peace, and most importantly, spiritual nourishment. He ensures that we are equipped to face every situation, providing for us in ways that reflect His love and faithfulness. **More Scriptures**
  
- Psalm 34:9–10: “Fear the Lord, you His godly people, for those who fear Him will have all they need. Even strong young lions sometimes go hungry, but those who trust in the Lord will lack no good thing.”
- Psalm 84:11: “For the Lord God is our light and protector. He gives us favor and honor. The Lord will withhold no good thing from those whose walk is blameless (upright).”
- Psalm 23:1 (NLT): “The Lord is my shepherd; I have all that I need.”
- Philippians 4:19 (NLT): “And this same God who takes care of me will supply all your needs from His glorious riches, which have been given to us in Christ Jesus.”
- Matthew 6:31–33 (NLT): “So don’t worry about these things, saying, ‘What will we eat? What will we drink? What will we wear?’ … Seek the Kingdom of God above all else, and live righteously, and He will give you everything you need.”
- 2 Corinthians 9:8 (NLT): “And God will generously provide all you need. Then you will always have everything you need and plenty left over to share with others.”
- Deuteronomy 2:7 (NLT): “For the Lord your God has blessed you in everything you have done. He has watched your every step through this great wilderness. During these forty years, the Lord your God has been with you, and you have lacked nothing.”

### **Good Health and Strength**
Living in alignment with God's Word also brings divine health and strength. While this does not mean we will never experience sickness, it is a promise of God’s continual presence, healing power, and sustaining strength throughout our lives.  
- **“Worship the Lord your God… and I will take away sickness from among you”** (Exodus 23:25).  
  God promises to remove disease and illness from His people who honor Him with their lives. By living righteously, we not only honor God, but we also align ourselves with His life-giving power. His grace empowers us to maintain good health, and His healing presence restores us when we fall ill. **More Scriptures**:
  
- Isaiah 40:29–31: “He gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak... those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength.”
- 3 John 1:2: “Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and be in health, just as your soul prospers.”
- Psalm 103:2–3: “Praise the Lord… who forgives all your sins and heals all your diseases.”
- Proverbs 3:7–8: “Fear the Lord and shun evil. This will bring health to your body and nourishment to your bones.”

### **Riches and Hidden Treasures**
God offers riches that transcend mere material wealth. His blessings often come in ways we cannot predict, bringing favor, opportunities, wisdom, and spiritual prosperity.  
- **“I will give you the treasures of darkness and riches stored in secret places…”** (Isaiah 45:3).  
  God speaks of treasures hidden in the “darkness” and “secret places”—things that are not immediately obvious or accessible to the world. These treasures are blessings that come as a result of faithful living—wisdom, understanding, peace, and even unexpected material blessings. God rewards those who seek Him with a heart of obedience and faith. **More Scriptures**

- Proverbs 10:22: “The blessing of the Lord makes rich, and He adds no sorrow with it.”
- Deuteronomy 8:18: “But remember the Lord your God, for it is He who gives you the power to get wealth…”
- 2 Chronicles 1:12: “I will also give you wealth, possessions and honor, such as no king who was before you ever had…”
- Psalm 112:1–3: “Blessed is the man who fears the Lord… Wealth and riches are in his house…”

### **Fruitfulness**
A godly life produces fruit in every area of existence: spiritual fruit, emotional well-being, and prosperity in relationships, career, and purpose. Fruitfulness is evidence of God's blessing, showing that we are living in alignment with His will.  
- **“If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land”** (Isaiah 1:19).  
  God promises that when we are willing and obedient to His call, we will experience abundance. Fruitfulness in the land symbolizes blessings in all areas of life: joy, peace, prosperity, and fulfillment. By aligning with God's Word and will, we become effective instruments of His blessing to the world around us. **More Scriptures**
  
- John 15:5: “I am the vine; you are the branches… If you remain in Me and I in you, you will bear much fruit…”
- Genesis 1:28: “Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it…”
- Deuteronomy 28:11: “The Lord will grant you abundant prosperity… the fruit of your womb, the young of your livestock, and the crops of your ground.”
- Psalm 1:3: “He is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season…”
- Jeremiah 17:7–8: “Blessed is the one who trusts in the Lord… they will be like a tree planted by the water… never fail to bear fruit.”

### **Living Like Christ Through the Holy Spirit**

God created us to be His representatives on earth, reflecting His character and will to the world. This is why He calls us to live like Christ—an example of perfect holiness, love, and righteousness.  
- **“Whoever claims to live in Him must live as Jesus did”** (1 John 2:6).  
  The call to live like Christ is not just an ideal, but a command. Through the Holy Spirit, we are empowered to walk in His footsteps, showing kindness, humility, and grace in all that we do.

However, living like Christ is not possible through human effort alone. We need the **Holy Spirit** to guide, strengthen, and empower us.  
- **“You, however, are not in the realm of the flesh but are in the realm of the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God lives in you”** (Romans 8:9).  
  The Holy Spirit is the key to living a godly life. He enables us to overcome the power of sin, live with divine wisdom, and bear fruit that pleases God. Through the Spirit, we are able to reflect Christ’s character in our lives.

But, the Holy Spirit cannot dwell in a heart that continues to live in unrepented sin. Sin blocks the flow of God's power and guidance in our lives. This includes actions such as lying, harboring anger, unforgiveness, and sexual immorality.  
- **“Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption”** (Ephesians 4:30).  
  Sin creates separation between us and God. When we continue in sin without repentance, we hinder the Holy Spirit’s work in our lives, making it difficult to live as God intended.

- **“The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like”** (Galatians 5:19-21).  
  These sinful behaviors are incompatible with the life the Holy Spirit desires to produce in us. To experience God’s blessings, we must live a life of repentance and seek to live in holiness.

---

### **Conclusion: Living a Godly Life Brings Abundant Blessings**

In conclusion, living a life that honors God through obedience and reverence is the pathway to experiencing His abundant blessings. Whether it is protection, provision, health, or spiritual fruitfulness, God promises to bless those who live according to His will. The key to receiving these blessings is living a life empowered by the Holy Spirit, free from the entanglements of sin.

**Living like Christ** is not just about moral behavior but about aligning our hearts with God’s purpose for our lives, with the Holy Spirit leading and empowering us. As we walk in His ways, we experience the fullness of His promises and are equipped to fulfill the purpose for which we were created.

## **Why the Enemy Seems to Prevail**

The devil, although a powerful adversary, does not possess inherent power on his own. He is a defeated foe, with no authority over those who belong to God. His only power comes from deceiving and manipulating people, often exploiting their ignorance of God's Word. Jesus describes him as the thief who comes only to "steal, kill, and destroy" (John 10:10). He seeks to wreak havoc in the lives of those who are unprotected by Christ, seeking to lead them away from the truth and into bondage.

### **The Enemy Exploits Ignorance**
If someone does not have Christ in their heart, they are vulnerable to spiritual attack. Without the protection of God’s truth and the authority of Christ, the enemy can deceive and control them through lies, temptation, and fear.  
- **“My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge”** (Hosea 4:6).  
  Ignorance of God's Word makes individuals easy targets for the enemy’s schemes. Without a firm understanding of the gospel and God's promises, a person can easily fall prey to the devil’s deception.

The devil’s primary methods involve:
- **Deception**: He twists God's truth, leading people into confusion, fear, and doubt.
- **Division**: He seeks to divide relationships, families, and even churches through bitterness, unforgiveness, and strife.
- **Temptation**: He entices people to sin, offering false promises of satisfaction that ultimately lead to destruction (James 1:13-15).
- **Accusation**: He tries to bring shame and guilt upon believers, making them feel unworthy of God's love and forgiveness.

For those outside of Christ, this spiritual vulnerability means that they can be ensnared by addiction, destructive behaviors, or even direct spiritual oppression. However, in Christ, believers are equipped with the armor of God (Ephesians 6:10-18), which protects them from the schemes of the enemy.

### **Spiritual Attacks on Believers**
Even believers, those who have received Christ into their hearts, are not immune from spiritual attacks. While they are protected by God’s divine covering, they are still living in a fallen world, and the enemy seeks to undermine their faith, particularly during times of trial or hardship.

- **Wilderness Seasons and Doubt**  
  There are moments in every believer’s life where they will face difficulty, confusion, or pain. These seasons, known as the "wilderness," can be places of spiritual testing, where the enemy seeks to sow seeds of doubt.  
  - **John the Baptist**, a prophet who boldly declared that Jesus was the Messiah (John 1:29–34), found himself questioning God's plan while suffering in prison. He sent his disciples to ask Jesus, *“Are You the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?”* (Matthew 11:2–6).  
    Even John, who had recognized Jesus as the Lamb of God, was shaken during a time of personal suffering. This shows that even the most faithful can struggle with doubts in the midst of trials.

  - **Job** is another example of a righteous man enduring unimaginable suffering. Job lost his wealth, his children, and his health, yet he remained steadfast in his faith. In the depths of his grief and physical torment, he declared, *“Though He slay me, yet will I trust Him”* (Job 13:15).  
    Job’s story illustrates that faith does not guarantee immunity from suffering, but it does provide the strength to endure, knowing that God is in control even in the darkest moments. 

During these wilderness seasons, the enemy’s goal is to convince believers that God has abandoned them or that God’s promises are no longer true. He tries to make them question God's love and timing, leading them to either turn away from God or grow discouraged. However, like Job, believers must remember that God is faithful and His plans for us are always good, even when they don’t make sense in the moment.

### **God's Sovereignty Over All**
Scripture assures us that God is in control and that no one can leave this world before their appointed time. Every believer’s life is in God’s hands, and He alone determines the length of their days.  
- **“The Lord will not allow the righteous to perish before their time”** (Ecclesiastes 7:17).  
  Despite the enemy’s attempts to destroy, God’s plan for His children cannot be thwarted. Even during times of intense suffering, believers can rest in the knowledge that God’s sovereign will is at work in their lives, even if they cannot see it immediately.

- **Lamentations 3:37** reminds us that, “Who can speak and have it happen if the Lord has not decreed it?” Every event, every trial, and every season of suffering is under God’s divine sovereignty, and He uses it to shape believers into the image of Christ.  
  - **“My times are in Your hands”** (Psalm 31:15).  
    This verse assures believers that their lives are guided by God’s loving hands. No matter what comes, they can trust that He is overseeing their journey and working everything for their good (Romans 8:28).

### **The Mystery of Early Death**
There are instances when believers may die young, which can be a painful and perplexing reality. However, even in these moments, it is important to understand that their lives are still in God’s hands, and their deaths are not without purpose.  
- **“Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His faithful servants”** (Psalm 116:15).  
  God does not delight in the death of His saints, but He values their lives and welcomes them into eternal peace with Him. For those who die young, God’s purposes are still fulfilled, and their lives, though short, bring glory to Him. Their passing may leave a lasting legacy, inspiring others to live for Christ.

The death of believers, even at a young age, is part of God’s sovereign plan. It is a reminder that our time on earth is temporary, and our true home is in heaven. While we may not understand why certain things happen, we can trust that God’s perspective is eternal, and He knows what is best for His children.

- **“For me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain”** (Philippians 1:21).  
  The apostle Paul’s words offer comfort in the face of death. For the believer, death is not the end but a transition to eternal life with Christ. While we mourn the loss of loved ones, we can trust that death, even untimely, is under God's sovereign control and part of His greater plan.

---

### **Conclusion: The Final Victory**
In summary, although the enemy may seem to prevail for a season, his ultimate defeat is assured. Christ has already won the victory over sin, death, and the devil, and His power is greater than anything the enemy can do. Believers may experience spiritual attacks, suffering, and even death, but they can be confident that God is in control, and nothing happens outside of His sovereign will.  
- **“In all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us”** (Romans 8:37).  
  Ultimately, the believer’s victory is certain in Christ. Even in moments of doubt and struggle, God remains faithful, and His plan for our lives is always perfect, even when we cannot see it.

## **Living Without Christ is Living Without Protection**

Without the covering of Jesus Christ, individuals are vulnerable to the attacks of the enemy. The enemy has free access to those who are not protected by the blood of Jesus, and he seeks to steal, kill, and destroy (John 10:10). People who live outside of Christ are exposed to spiritual warfare, temptation, and oppression without the divine protection that only Christ can provide.

### **The Vulnerability of Those Without Christ**
Without the shield of God's protection, those who do not have Christ in their hearts are like "chaff that the wind drives away" (Psalm 1:4). Chaff, the husk or outer shell of grain, is light, frail, and easily blown away by the wind. In the same way, those who are not grounded in Christ are subject to the whims of the enemy, tossed about by spiritual forces beyond their control.

- **Job 22:16** says, “They die before their time.” This points to the reality that living outside of God’s protection can lead to premature death or tragic circumstances. The enemy preys upon the vulnerable, often cutting lives short when people are not under the umbrella of God's grace.

- **Romans 6:23** highlights the consequences of sin, “The wages of sin is death.” Without Christ, the penalty of sin is eternal separation from God, both in this life and the next. Sin, whether manifested in habits, addictions, or rebellious actions, carries the weight of death—spiritual, emotional, and sometimes even physical. Without the redemptive power of Jesus, individuals live without hope, direction, and the ultimate protection from the wrath to come.

### **Spiritual Exposure to the Enemy’s Attacks**
Living without Christ opens the door for the enemy to exert influence over a person’s life. People who are not covered by the blood of Jesus lack the spiritual armor necessary to stand firm against Satan’s schemes. The enemy seeks to exploit every weakness, causing people to fall into sin, addiction, and other destructive behaviors.

#### **Occultism and Spiritual Bondage:**
Many who live without Christ become ensnared by the occult or other demonic practices, whether knowingly or unknowingly. Occultists and spiritual manipulators prey on the lost and vulnerable, leading them further into darkness. Without Christ, people are susceptible to spiritual bondage, which can manifest in unhealthy attachments, curses, and oppressive forces that are impossible to break without the power of Jesus.

#### **Addiction and Destruction:**
Addiction is another area where the enemy seeks to destroy lives. People who do not have the protective covering of Christ can easily fall into the trap of addiction, whether to drugs, alcohol, or other harmful behaviors. These addictions often serve as a substitute for the peace and fulfillment that only Christ can provide, leaving individuals trapped in cycles of hopelessness, despair, and destruction.

#### **Tragic Loss and Premature Death:**
Tragically, many people who live outside of Christ experience sudden and unexpected deaths, whether through accidents, violence, or illness. Without the divine protection that comes from a relationship with Jesus, individuals are left vulnerable to the dangers of a broken world. The enemy does not discriminate, and his attacks can come swiftly and unexpectedly. But in Christ, there is a shield—a divine covering that guards the believer from the schemes of the adversary.

### **Only in Christ is There Safety**
While life outside of Christ is fraught with danger, there is a place of refuge and safety in Him. “The name of the Lord is a strong tower; the righteous run to it and are safe” (Proverbs 18:10). Jesus offers His protection to all who call upon His name, and His presence shields us from the attacks of the enemy. Those who are in Christ are not immune to challenges, but they are equipped with the spiritual resources to overcome them.

- **Psalm 91:1-2** assures believers: *“Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of the Lord, ‘He is my refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust.’”*  
  This passage speaks of the divine protection that those who are in a relationship with God enjoy. In Christ, we find shelter, rest, and safety from the enemy’s attacks.

- **Ephesians 6:10-18** describes the full armor of God that believers are given to protect themselves from the enemy’s schemes. This includes the belt of truth, the breastplate of righteousness, the shield of faith, and the helmet of salvation. With Christ, we are equipped to stand firm in faith and resist the devil.

### **The Call to Safety in Christ**
Jesus invites all to come under His protection, offering peace, security, and eternal life. Without Him, there is no true safety, no lasting hope, and no spiritual protection from the darkness of this world.

- **John 14:6**: *“I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”*  
  Christ is the only way to true safety—spiritually, emotionally, and even physically. Those who accept Jesus into their lives gain access to the divine protection that comes from being a child of God.

Without Christ, people are exposed to all the dangers of a fallen world. But in Christ, there is safety, peace, and a divine covering that cannot be shaken. **Choose Christ**, and live under His protection, because only in Him is there true safety from the enemy’s attacks and the consequences of sin.

## **Christ Gives Authority Over the Enemy**

Jesus made a powerful declaration in **Luke 10:19**: *“I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy.”*  
This statement is not just a promise but an impartation of divine authority that belongs to every believer in Christ. Through the victory of Jesus on the cross, we are granted authority to stand firm and resist the devil’s schemes. Jesus’ words remind us that we are not powerless; we are empowered to overcome all of the enemy’s attacks.

### **Authority to Overcome All the Power of the Enemy**
The authority given to believers is not limited or temporary. It extends over **all** the power of the enemy, which means that nothing is beyond Christ’s victory. This includes spiritual attacks, oppression, temptation, sickness, and any force that seeks to destroy or hinder the believer’s walk with God. The devil may try to intimidate or deceive, but he has no true authority over a child of God who stands in the authority of Christ.

In **Ephesians 6:12**, we are reminded that our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against spiritual forces of evil. But with Christ, we can resist these forces. As believers, we have been equipped with the spiritual armor and authority to stand firm and fight back.

### **Fear Not: The Holy Spirit is Our Shield**
We do not need to live in fear, for the **Holy Spirit** is our constant protector. **Isaiah 59:19** declares, *“When the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against him.”* The Holy Spirit is the believer’s shield, standing between us and every attack of the enemy. We are not alone in our battles; the Holy Spirit empowers us to resist fear, worry, and anxiety, allowing us to stand in the face of adversity with boldness and faith.

When we live by the Spirit, we are reminded that fear is not from God. **2 Timothy 1:7** says, *“For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and a sound mind.”* This divine protection is a promise from God, assuring us that no matter the trials we face, we can stand firm because of the presence of the Holy Spirit within us.

### **Living in Holiness: Our Divine Protection**
As believers, when we walk in holiness, we become living testimonies of God’s power and protection. **Hebrews 1:7** describes the righteous as *“flames of fire.”* Holiness is not about perfection but about living a life dedicated to God’s will, walking in His ways, and being set apart for His purposes. In doing so, we become vessels that reflect God’s glory and, as such, are surrounded by a hedge of divine protection. This is seen in the example of **Job 1:10**, where Satan acknowledges the protective hedge that God had placed around Job’s life.

By living in alignment with God’s will and pursuing righteousness, we also activate God's promises of protection. **Psalm 91:9-10** assures us: *“If you make the Most High your dwelling— even the Lord, who is my refuge— then no harm will overtake you, no disaster will come near your tent.”* Holiness keeps us in a place of safety, positioning us within God’s divine covering.

### **Our Life’s Purpose: Written in God’s Book**
Our lives are not random or without purpose. **Psalm 139:16** says, *“Your eyes saw my unformed body; all the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be.”* God has a divine plan for each of us, a specific purpose that we can only fulfill through relationship with Him. Christ’s authority over the enemy is integral to fulfilling that purpose because the enemy will do everything in his power to distract or destroy us.

As we walk in obedience to God, relying on His power and authority, we align ourselves with His will. **Romans 8:28** assures us that all things work together for good for those who love God and are called according to His purpose. The authority given to us in Christ empowers us to fulfill the purpose God has designed for our lives, and to walk through each season with divine protection and purpose.

### **Conclusion: Walking in Authority**
When we understand and embrace the authority that Christ has given us, we no longer live in fear or uncertainty. We can confidently stand against the enemy's schemes and move forward in our God-given purpose. Through the Holy Spirit, we are shielded from harm, empowered to resist temptation, and able to live lives that reflect the glory of God.

**Luke 10:19** is not just a promise for victory but a reminder of the incredible power that belongs to us as believers. We are called to exercise that authority in every area of our lives, knowing that we are protected, empowered, and equipped by the Holy Spirit. As we live according to God’s will and seek His righteousness, we fulfill the purpose He has ordained for us, walking in victory over the enemy every step of the way.

## **Fear is from the Devil**

Fear is one of the most powerful weapons that Satan uses against believers. It is a tool designed to paralyze, intimidate, and control, causing people to live in constant anxiety, doubt, and insecurity. **Fear** can grip the heart and mind, clouding judgment, and preventing individuals from walking in the fullness of God's promises. It is through fear that the enemy tries to manipulate and deceive, aiming to rob believers of their peace, joy, and spiritual authority.

### **Satan’s Weapon of Intimidation**
Fear is not from God. It is a tactic of the enemy to keep believers in bondage, preventing them from stepping into their God-given purpose and authority. Satan knows that if he can get a believer to fear, he can weaken their resolve and hinder their faith. Fear makes us focus on the threats and dangers that surround us, rather than trusting in God’s power and promises. 

The Bible speaks clearly about the origin of fear. In **2 Timothy 1:7**, Paul writes, *“For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and a sound mind.”* This verse reminds us that fear is not a gift from God, but instead, we have been given a spirit of **power**, **love**, and **soundness of mind**. Power to overcome any challenge, love to overcome hatred and bitterness, and a sound mind to discern and act according to God's will. Fear has no place in the life of a believer because the Spirit of God living inside us is far greater than any threat or danger that may come our way.

### **God's Promise of Protection from Fear**
God promises His protection against fear, offering assurance that He will keep us safe from harm. **Psalm 91:5** declares, *“You shall not fear the terror by night, nor the arrow that flies by day.”* This powerful verse assures us that we are not subject to fear, regardless of the circumstances or the times in which we live. Whether the threat is visible or invisible, whether it comes in the form of physical danger, spiritual attack, or emotional turmoil, we are promised freedom from fear when we dwell in the shelter of the Most High.

Fear attempts to rob believers of their peace, but when we trust in God's protection, we can stand firm and say that we will not fear what may come. This does not mean that we are exempt from difficulties or struggles, but rather that we have the divine assurance that God is with us through it all. His presence is a shield against every form of fear, whether it’s the fear of the unknown, fear of failure, fear of death, or fear of the enemy’s attacks.

### **Fear Is a Paralyzer**
Fear paralyzes, keeping us from moving forward in life and in faith. It causes people to second-guess themselves, hesitate, and ultimately miss opportunities or refuse to walk in their God-given calling. Fear brings torment and confusion, making it difficult to take bold steps of faith. **1 John 4:18** says, *“There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love.”* As we grow in our relationship with God and embrace His perfect love, we are empowered to overcome the fear that seeks to hold us back.

The enemy will always attempt to use fear to discourage us, but we must remember that **God’s love** is far stronger than any fear. It is His love that frees us from the chains of fear, enabling us to move forward in His purpose with courage and confidence.

### **The Remedy: Trusting in God's Power and Love**
When fear tries to grip our hearts, the remedy is not to dwell on our own strength, but to trust in the **power** and **love** of God. We have been given the **power** to overcome fear, not through our own might but through the Holy Spirit who dwells within us. We can stand firm in the knowledge that we are never alone, for God is with us every step of the way.

As **Romans 8:31** assures us, *“If God is for us, who can be against us?”* Fear loses its power when we realize that we are not fighting our battles alone. God fights for us, and His love is a powerful weapon against the forces of fear.

### **Victory Over Fear**
The key to overcoming fear is not to deny its existence, but to confront it with the truth of God’s Word. Fear cannot stand against the power of **God’s promises**. The more we immerse ourselves in His Word and remind ourselves of His love, the less power fear will have over us. Fear may come knocking, but we can confidently send it away with the authority that Christ has given us.

In **Philippians 4:6-7**, we are encouraged, *“Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.”* When we bring our anxieties before God and trust in His protection, His peace takes the place of fear, guarding our hearts and minds.

### **Conclusion: Fear Has No Place in a Believer's Life**
Fear is a tool the enemy uses to undermine faith, paralyze purpose, and keep believers from walking in God’s fullness. But the Bible assures us that fear has no place in the life of a believer. **God has not given us a spirit of fear**, and we are called to walk in power, love, and a sound mind. With God’s promises of protection, we can resist the spirit of fear and stand strong in faith, knowing that He is with us and that nothing can separate us from His love.

The next time fear tries to overwhelm you, remember that God’s Word is stronger. Stand firm in His promises, trust in His protection, and know that in Christ, you have been given the victory over fear.

## **You Must Give Your Life to Christ**

If you have experienced trauma such as molestation, abuse, or are currently living in sin, the first step toward healing, deliverance, and true progress is surrendering your life to **Jesus Christ**. Jesus is the only one who can bring complete healing and restoration to the brokenness that sin and life’s hardships create. Without Him, you cannot truly heal, be delivered, or move forward in life. He is the only way to experience freedom from the chains that hold you down.

### **The Binding Power of Sin**
Living in sin—whether it is pornography, fornication, adultery, or any other immoral practices—creates a spiritual bondage that ties your soul to darkness. **1 Corinthians 6:18–20** speaks clearly about the consequences of sexual immorality: *“Flee from sexual immorality... Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your bodies.”* When we live in sin, we not only dishonor God but also invite the influence of the enemy into our lives, giving him access to our hearts, minds, and bodies.

Sin is a gateway for **demonic oppression and bondage**, and the more we indulge in sin, the more we open doors for the enemy to operate in our lives. He comes to steal, kill, and destroy (John 10:10), and his aim is to keep us trapped in cycles of shame, guilt, and despair. However, when we choose to surrender to Jesus, we break those chains, and His blood cleanses us from all unrighteousness (1 John 1:9).

### **The Enemy’s Strategy: Targeting Your Purpose**
Satan has always sought to destroy the lives and destinies of those whom God has set apart. **Young people**, especially those with divine gifts and callings on their lives, are prime targets for the enemy. One of the most common strategies of the enemy is to exploit **sexual sin** to corrupt a person’s purpose and turn them away from God’s plan. By leading individuals into sin, particularly through lust and immorality, the enemy seeks to distract them from their God-given potential and align them with his purposes instead.

For many, this begins at a young age, often through experiences of abuse, exploitation, or temptation. The enemy knows that if he can steal their purity, he can derail their destiny. However, **God has a purpose for each life**, and no matter how far off course you may have gone, you can turn back to Him and begin a new chapter.

### **The Power of Surrender: Healing and Restoration**
There is **hope**. The good news of the gospel is that **Jesus came to heal the brokenhearted**, to set the captives free, and to restore what was lost. His grace is greater than our past, and His love is stronger than any sin or pain we have experienced. **Isaiah 61:1–3** speaks of the purpose of Jesus: *“The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is on me, because the Lord has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor... to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners...”* Jesus offers us **freedom** from all forms of bondage, whether physical, emotional, or spiritual.

When you give your life to Christ, you enter into a new identity. You become a new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17), and all things, including your past mistakes, regrets, and scars, are made new in Him. You no longer have to be defined by what happened to you or by the sins you've committed. Jesus offers you a fresh start, a clean slate, and the ability to walk in His divine purpose for your life.

### **Surrender: The First Step Toward True Freedom**
Surrendering your life to Christ means submitting to Him completely, acknowledging that you cannot do it on your own, and that you need His help to heal and overcome. **Romans 10:9** says, *“If you declare with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.”* Salvation is not just a one-time event; it’s an ongoing process of healing, transformation, and walking in the light of God’s truth.

When you give your life to Christ, He will begin the work of healing the wounds of your past, breaking the power of sin over your life, and filling you with His Holy Spirit to empower you to live the life He designed for you. He is the ultimate healer and deliverer.

### **Conclusion: There Is Hope in Christ**
No matter how deep the wounds, how strong the chains, or how hopeless your situation may feel, there is always **hope** in Christ. His love is greater than anything you’ve experienced, and His power is sufficient to break every chain. Choose today to give your life to Jesus Christ, to surrender your will, and allow Him to heal you, deliver you, and restore your purpose.

You are not defined by your past, but by the love and grace of Jesus. The enemy may have tried to steal your joy, purpose, and identity, but in Christ, you have the opportunity to receive restoration, freedom, and a future filled with hope.

## **If You’re a New Christian – Stay Strong**

Congratulations on making the most important decision of your life—giving your life to **Jesus Christ**. By doing so, you have made a bold stand, and in a spiritual sense, you have just declared war on the enemy. However, take comfort in knowing that you are not alone in this journey. **1 John 4:4** encourages you with the powerful truth: *“Greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world.”* The Holy Spirit, who resides in you, is far more powerful than the enemy, and with God's strength, you can overcome any challenge that comes your way.

Now that you've taken the first step of faith, it's essential to **stay strong** and continue to grow in your relationship with God. The enemy will try to discourage and tempt you, but by staying rooted in Christ and drawing from His strength, you will remain steadfast.

### **1. Read and Meditate on God’s Word**
The Word of God is the foundation of your faith and the ultimate weapon against the enemy. **Psalm 1:2** says, *“But his delight is in the law of the Lord, and on His law, he meditates day and night.”* As a new believer, it’s crucial to **dwell in the Word** daily. Let Scripture transform your mind, fill your heart with truth, and guide your decisions.

- Start by reading the Bible regularly, even if it's just a few verses each day.
- Meditate on what you read, allowing it to sink deep into your heart and mind.
- Let God's Word renew your thoughts and attitudes, helping you become more like Christ.

### **2. Pray and Fast**
Prayer is your direct line of communication with God. It is how you build intimacy with Him and seek His guidance. **Mark 9:29** reminds us that there are certain things we can only overcome through **prayer and fasting**. Prayer gives you access to God’s power, strength, and wisdom, while fasting helps you deny your flesh and focus more on the things of the Spirit.

- Set aside regular times for prayer—both speaking to God and listening for His response.
- Consider fasting occasionally to grow in spiritual discipline and reliance on God.
- Through prayer, you align your heart with God’s will and strengthen your resolve against the enemy’s attacks.

### **3. Stay in Fellowship with Other Believers**
The Christian walk is not meant to be walked alone. As a new Christian, you need the support, encouragement, and accountability that come from being part of a **community of believers**. **Hebrews 10:25** urges us not to forsake gathering together: *“Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one another—and all the more as you see the Day approaching.”*

- Find a local church where you can worship, learn, and grow alongside others.
- Join small groups or Bible studies to deepen your understanding of God’s Word and develop close relationships with other believers.
- Allow fellow Christians to encourage you, pray with you, and support you in your spiritual journey.

### **Stay Strong in the Lord**
Remember, your strength comes from the Lord. As you read His Word, pray, fast, and fellowship with other believers, you will grow in faith and become more equipped to stand firm against the enemy's schemes. Be patient with yourself, stay committed to your spiritual growth, and trust that God is faithful to complete the work He has started in you (Philippians 1:6).

You are now part of God’s family, and He is with you every step of the way. Be encouraged, for **greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world**. Stay strong, keep pressing forward, and live out your new life in Christ with courage and faith.

## **If You’re Not Yet Born Again – The Time is Now**

Your decision to follow Christ is the most important one you will ever make. No matter your background, religion, nationality, or situation—**Jesus will receive you** with open arms. 

He offers forgiveness, salvation, and eternal life. Today is the day of salvation, and God is calling you. Don’t put off what you can do today. Respond to His voice and let Him transform your life.
