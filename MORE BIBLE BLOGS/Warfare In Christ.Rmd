**Dear brothers and sisters in Christ**,

Many sincere believers raise heartfelt questions about spiritual warfare and whether it is right to pray ‚ÄúBack to Sender‚Äù prayers. Verses such as ‚ÄúSuffer not a witch to live‚Äù (Exodus 22:18) and ‚ÄúHe who digs a pit will fall into it‚Äù (Proverbs 26:27) are often cited. These verses are part of the inspired Word of God, but **must be interpreted through the lens of Christ**, who fulfilled the law and brought a new covenant of grace (Matthew 5:17).

## From Physical Battles to Spiritual Warfare

The Old Testament dealt heavily in physical laws, punishments, and battles, but these were **shadows of deeper spiritual truths** later revealed in Christ (Colossians 2:17). In the New Testament, we are called to fight differently. Jesus shifted the focus from physical retaliation to spiritual victory through love and grace.

Jesus said in Luke 6:27‚Äì28:

> ‚ÄúLove your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.‚Äù

Paul adds in Romans 12:19:

> ‚ÄúDo not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God‚Äôs wrath, for it is written: ‚ÄòIt is mine to avenge; I will repay,‚Äô says the Lord.‚Äù

We are to **pray against evil**, yes‚Äîbut **never against people**. We pray for protection, we cancel demonic assignments, and we resist the devil spiritually. But we **do not curse or celebrate the downfall of others**, no matter what they‚Äôve done.

## Understanding the Real Enemy

Ephesians 6:12 tells us clearly:

> ‚ÄúFor we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities‚Ä¶ against spiritual wickedness in high places.‚Äù

Our enemy is not people‚Äîit is **Satan, the deceiver**, who uses people as tools when they open doors to him.

Paul said in Romans 7:15‚Äì17:

> ‚ÄúFor I do not do what I want, but do the very thing I hate‚Ä¶ it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells in me.‚Äù

Cain killed Abel because he opened the door to sin through anger and jealousy. Saul tried to kill David because jealousy entered his heart after the women praised David. The devil exploited both. Judas betrayed Jesus after he opened the door of his heart to Satan (Luke 22:3).

Do not give the **devil a foothold** through sin‚Äîespecially through **anger, bitterness, or unforgiveness**. As Ephesians 4:26‚Äì27 warns:
> "In your anger do not sin. Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry, and do not give the devil a foothold."

When we harbor unresolved anger or unforgiveness, we open spiritual doors that the enemy can exploit. Instead, deal with offenses quickly, forgive from the heart, and walk in the Spirit‚Äîlest the enemy misuse you as a vessel of division or harm.

We must view people with compassion and intercede for them, not retaliate against them.

So we must remember: **those who harm us are not the true enemy**‚Äîthey are often wounded, lost, or deceived souls. We must pray for their deliverance, not their destruction.

## Authority in Christ Must Not Be Misused


As believers in Jesus Christ, we are given genuine spiritual authority to stand against the works of darkness. This authority is given to the upright only for righteous purposes. 

Jesus said:

> "Behold, I give you authority to trample on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you"  
> ‚Äî Luke 10:19 (NKJV)

This authority is not for personal gain, vengeance, or pride‚Äîbut to:

- Establish God's Kingdom  
- Bring freedom to the oppressed  
- Glorify Jesus Christ  

### We Are Called to Destroy the Works of the Enemy

> "For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil"  
> ‚Äî 1 John 3:8

As His ambassadors (2 Corinthians 5:20), we are entrusted to continue His mission‚Äînot in our strength, but by His Spirit:

> ‚Äú‚ÄòNot by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,‚Äô says the Lord of hosts.‚Äù  
> ‚Äî Zechariah 4:6

### We are commissioned to:

- üõ°Ô∏è Rebuke and cast out demons (Mark 16:17)  
- üõ†Ô∏è Tear down spiritual strongholds (2 Corinthians 10:4‚Äì5)  
- üîó Bind and loose in alignment with God‚Äôs will‚Äînot people, but spiritual influences, systems, and forces of darkness (Matthew 18:18)  
- üèÉ Resist the devil, knowing he must flee (James 4:7)  


### We Must Not Return Evil for Evil

Though we are in a spiritual battle, our warfare is not carnal (2 Corinthians 10:3). We are not called to return curses or fire back evil arrows. Instead, we break and nullify them in the name of Jesus, standing in His righteousness and divine protection.

> ‚ÄúNo weapon formed against you shall prosper, and every tongue which rises against you in judgment You shall condemn.  
> This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness is from Me,‚Äù says the LORD.  
> ‚Äî Isaiah 54:17

> "Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good."  
> ‚Äî Romans 12:21

Let us never imitate the enemy‚Äôs methods. Jesus taught us to:

- ‚ù§Ô∏è Love our enemies (Matthew 5:44)  
- üôè Leave vengeance to God (Romans 12:19)

Spiritual authority is never a license to act out of bitterness, pride, or fear. **We don‚Äôt need to return arrows‚Äîwe need to cancel, dissolve, and break them by the power of Christ's blood and Word.**

### Walk in Humility and Alignment with God

Authority without submission is dangerous. Even Jesus said:

> ‚ÄúI do nothing of Myself; but as My Father taught Me, I speak these things‚Äù  
> ‚Äî John 8:28

If the Son of God modeled full submission, how much more should we?

We must:

- üßé Be clothed in humility (1 Peter 5:5‚Äì6)  
- üìñ Stay rooted in God's Word (Psalm 119:105)  
- üî• Be filled with the Holy Spirit (Ephesians 5:18)  
- ‚úùÔ∏è Daily die to self, so Christ may live in us (Galatians 2:20)

But we must never use this authority to:

- Return curses
- Speak death over people
- Operate out of flesh, anger, or pride

May we exercise our authority with wisdom, compassion, and spiritual discernment‚Äîalways aligned with the heart of God.

Spiritual authority must always reflect the **fruit of the Spirit** (Galatians 5:22‚Äì23) and the **character of Christ**.

## Security in Christ: No Fear, No Retaliation

As true believers walking in righteousness, you are covered by the blood of Jesus. There is no need to fear witches, curses, or spells.

Psalm 91:9‚Äì10 gives us this beautiful promise:

> ‚ÄúIf you make the Lord your refuge‚Ä¶ no evil will conquer you; no plague will come near your home.‚Äù

And Jeremiah 3:37 says:

> ‚ÄúWho can command something to happen without the Lord‚Äôs permission?‚Äù

So even if someone speaks evil against you or practices witchcraft, **nothing can happen unless God permits it**‚Äîand if you walk with Him, you are shielded. No curse, no spell, no evil decree can stick if the Lord has not approved it.

Isaiah 54:17 says:

> ‚ÄúNo weapon formed against you shall prosper, and every tongue that rises against you in judgment you shall condemn.‚Äù

Our role is not to send harm back, but to stand in faith and speak life, walk in truth, and wage warfare in the Spirit.
These truths anchor our security‚Äî**not in ‚Äúsending evil back,‚Äù but in speaking life, walking in truth and standing firm in faith under God‚Äôs covenant protection** and authority through Christ.

God is sovereign, and nothing can touch you without His permission (Job 1:10). We must learn to stand in victory, not react in fear or vengeance.

## A Call to Spiritual Maturity

Maturity means growing in love, mercy, and discernment.

**We are called not to rejoice in the downfall of others**, even those who have wronged us.

> ‚ÄúDo not gloat when your enemy falls, and do not let your heart rejoice when he stumbles, or the LORD will see and disapprove.‚Äù
‚Äî Proverbs 24:17‚Äì18 (NIV)

Our aim is not destruction of souls but **their redemption**.  Do not condemn but restore others gently.

> ‚ÄúBrothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness.‚Äù
‚Äî Galatians 6:1 (ESV)

Jesus said:

> ‚ÄúLove your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven.‚Äù
‚Äî Matthew 5:44‚Äì45 (NIV)

We resist the enemy, but we love the souls he tries to deceive.

The enemy wants us to react in the flesh. But we are called to:

- Tear down demonic strongholds (2 Corinthians 10:4)

- Lift up people in prayer (1 Timothy 2:1)

- Respond in love and truth (Ephesians 4:15)

## In Conclusion

Our only true enemy is the devil. People are often victims of sin and deception. We overcome not by retaliation, but by:

- Walking in the truth of God‚Äôs Word (John 8:32)

- Clinging to grace and forgiveness (Colossians 3:13)

- Exercising righteous spiritual authority (Ephesians 6:10‚Äì18)

We overcome **not by returning evil for evil**, but by standing in **truth, love, and holy authority.**

May the Lord continue to guide us with wisdom, protect us with His presence, and mature us in the spirit of Christ, who came not to condemn, but to save.

With love and grace,  
‚Äî A fellow servant of Christ
