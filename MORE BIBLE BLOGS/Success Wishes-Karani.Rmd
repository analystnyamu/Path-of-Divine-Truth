## **Dear Karani,**

Warm greetings in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

First, allow me to congratulate you on successfully completing your **KCSE examinations**! This is a significant milestone in your life, and we give all the glory to God for guiding you through it. Your discipline, perseverance, and commitment have brought you this far, and we are truly proud of you.

As you step into this new season, I want you to remember a very important truth: **God already knows the next chapter of your life**. Your future is not hidden from Him. He has gone ahead of you, prepared your path, and ordained your steps. Your role now is simple—**trust Him, walk with Him, and allow Him to lead you into His perfect will**.

### **Beware of the Dangers That Destroy Young Destinies**

Karani, as you grow into adulthood, be aware that there are real dangers waiting to distract and destroy the destinies of many young people today. The world is full of traps designed to pull a young man away from God’s purpose. You must be alert and wise.

#### **1. Peer Pressure**
Not every friend is a blessing. Some friendships push people toward bad habits, wrong decisions, laziness, rebellion, and immorality.  
A single wrong friend can destroy years of good progress.

Choose friends who:

- Fear God  
- Respect themselves  
- Value education  
- Encourage you to grow  
- Add wisdom to your life  

Stay away from anyone who laughs at discipline, hates God, or pressures you into sin.

#### **2. Social Media Influence**
Today, social media is one of the biggest destroyers of focus and purity.  
It is full of:

- Immorality  
- Time-wasting content  
- Fake lifestyles  
- Negative influence  
- Ungodly trends  
- Addictions  

Do not allow your phone to become the reason you lose your future.  
Use technology wisely—let it build you, not break you.

Always ask yourself:  
**“Is this helping my destiny or weakening it?”**

#### **3. Disobedience to Parents**
One of the fastest ways to lose favor is to ignore the guidance of parents.

God has given parents:

- Insight  
- Experience  
- Spiritual authority  
- The responsibility to protect you  

When you obey your parents, you inherit blessing.  
When you disregard them, you open doors to unnecessary battles.

The Bible says:

> “Honor your father and mother…  
> that it may be well with you  
> and you may live long on the earth.”  
> — *Ephesians 6:2–3*

Obedience brings peace, long life, and favor.  
Your parents want the best for you—listen to their voice.

#### **4. The Danger of Early Relationships**
Do not rush into relationships or emotional attachments.  
Early involvement with “love,” girlfriends, or romantic pressure has destroyed countless young destinies.  
There is a time for everything, and relationships belong to a **mature season** when you are ready—spiritually, emotionally, and financially.

Guard your heart.  
Guard your purity.  
Guard your future.

### **Choosing God’s Voice Above All Others**

Life after KCSE brings many voices—some will encourage you, others will mislead you. Many young people get confused or discouraged at this stage because they listen to the wrong influences. But remember this:  
**not every voice deserves your attention.**

Listen to God before you listen to people. When you stay close to Him, He will give you:

- **Clarity** about your future  
- **Peace** in your decisions  
- **Strength** to resist pressure  
- **Direction** for the right opportunities  

> “Trust in the LORD with all your heart,  
> and lean not on your own understanding;  
> in all your ways acknowledge Him,  
> and He shall direct your paths.”  
> — *Proverbs 3:5–6*

### **Guarding Your Heart and Destiny**

Karani, your destiny is valuable. There are distractions today that pull young people away from God’s purpose—wrong friends, negative habits, online influences, laziness, and pressure to fit in.  
Please guard your heart. **Your future is too precious to be shaped by temporary pleasures or early mistakes.**

> “Blessed is the one who does not walk in step with the wicked…  
> but whose delight is in the law of the LORD.”  
> — *Psalm 1:1–2*

Surround yourself with:

- Good friends  
- Positive environments  
- Godly habits  
- Purposeful activities  

These will build you, not break you.

### **The Power of Waiting on God**

During this waiting season, do not be in a rush. Many young people hurry into decisions—careers, relationships, friendships—only to regret later. Every blessing has its appointed time.  
**Be patient. God’s timing is perfect.**

Use this season to:

- Pray  
- Reflect  
- Evaluate your goals  
- Strengthen your walk with Christ  
- Read Scripture to build your spiritual foundation  

This preparation will make you wiser and more focused when opportunities come.

### **Your Identity and Future Are in God’s Hands**

Never forget who you are—**a child of God, chosen and loved**. God has great plans for your life. He knows the desires of your heart, and He will fulfill them as you walk in obedience.

You may not know exactly what tomorrow holds, but you know the One who holds tomorrow. If you remain faithful to Him:

- Doors will open  
- Favor will follow you  
- Peace will surround you  
- Wisdom will guide you  

And in all things, **He will establish your steps**.

### **You Are Not Alone**

Always remember that your family stands with you. We are praying for you, believing in you, and supporting your journey. You are loved, valued, and destined for greatness.

May the Lord guide your steps, open the right doors, surround you with His favor, and grant you peace as you transition into the next stage of your life. **Walk with Him, and you will never miss your path.**

With prayers and blessings,  
**Mr. & Mrs. Martin**
