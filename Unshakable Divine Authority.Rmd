**Dear Beloved**,

I have listened to the recent sermon on breaking evil altars and spiritual warfare, and I felt led to share some thoughts and concerns that may help guide us all back to the truth of God's Word.

While I respect the sincerity of those teaching and their desire to help others, I believe that some aspects of this teaching stray from the true message of the Gospel and might be leading us into practices that are not in alignment with God’s Word.

## 1. The Danger of Using Rituals in Spiritual Warfare

One of the points raised in the sermon is that to break evil altars, believers need to offer living animals or money. I want to humbly remind us all that **Christ’s sacrifice on the cross** was the **final payment** for our sins. Hebrews 10:4 tells us that *“it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.”* Reverting to sacrifices or rituals like those used in witchcraft and divination cannot break the power of evil in our lives; **only the blood of Christ** has the power to do that (1 Peter 1:18-19).

The Bible warns us against using divination and witchcraft practices. In **Deuteronomy 18:10-12**, God commands His people to avoid these practices, and when we engage in rituals similar to those used by witches, we step away from the sufficiency of Christ's finished work on the cross.

## 2. Prayers of Retaliation: A Practice of Divination

Another teaching that needs careful reflection is the idea of praying “back to the sender.” While the Bible does talk about spiritual warfare, we are not called to seek revenge or to harm others through prayer (Romans 12:19). Matthew 5:44 teaches us to **love our enemies** and **pray for those who persecute us**. When we engage in prayers of vengeance, we enter into territory that mirrors the practices of witches and diviners—prayers that seek harm rather than healing. God’s Word calls us to forgive and leave vengeance to Him.

The true spiritual warfare that we are called to is not about attacking others but seeking to overcome evil with the power of God’s love. **Ephesians 6:12** reminds us that *“our struggle is not against flesh and blood,”* and **2 Corinthians 10:4** emphasizes that the weapons of our warfare are **not of the flesh** but have **divine power** to demolish strongholds.

## 3. The True Path to Break Strongholds: A Relationship with Christ

The way to break evil altars or any stronghold in our lives is not through rituals, sacrifices, or prayers of retaliation. The way is through **Christ**. In **John 10:10**, Jesus says, *“The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.”* Our victory comes through the **abundant life** we have in Jesus Christ, who empowers us to overcome sin, evil, and all the schemes of the enemy.

**Colossians 2:15** makes it clear that Jesus has already **disarmed the powers and authorities**, triumphing over them by the cross. This means that the power of death, curses, and strongholds has already been broken in Christ. For those who are in Christ, we are no longer slaves to fear, sin, or the power of evil altars.

## 4. Our Focus Should Be on Building a Relationship with God, Not Relying on Rituals

I want to gently remind all of us that the true focus of spiritual growth and deliverance is not in rituals, sacrifices, or manipulations but in **building a personal relationship with God** through Christ. The Bible clearly teaches us that salvation and deliverance are found in Christ alone (Acts 4:12). When we accept Jesus and follow His teachings, we are empowered by the **Holy Spirit** to overcome any spiritual challenge that comes our way.

**2 Corinthians 10:5** says, *“We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.”* This verse reminds us that true spiritual warfare is a matter of the **mind** and **heart**, not external rituals or sacrifices. Our victory is found in a **transformed mind**, a **heart surrendered to Christ**, and living in His truth.

## 5. The Importance of Studying God's Word and Praying Without Ceasing

After accepting Christ into our lives, we are called to **study the Word of God daily**. It is through consistent study of Scripture that the **Holy Spirit** helps us realize who we truly are in Christ—we are no longer under the power of the enemy. **Romans 8:1** says, *“Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.”* When we know our identity in Christ, we gain access to the **power of God** to destroy any family strongholds, evil altars, or generational curses through prayers and fasting. This is the true method for overcoming spiritual obstacles: aligning our hearts with God’s will and trusting in His power to bring deliverance.

## 6. Money, Household Items, and Animals: Offering Them in Love and Gratitude

When it comes to offerings, whether it be **money, household items, or even domestic animals**, these should only be used as a **sign of love and gratitude** to God, not as a means of purchasing favor or manipulating spiritual outcomes. **God is not in need of our possessions** (Psalm 50:10-12), but He desires a **heart of worship** that reflects a genuine love for Him.

In **Deuteronomy 16:16-17**, we are told to bring our offerings to God in a spirit of **joy** and **thankfulness**, not under compulsion or out of a desire to gain something in return: *“Each of you must bring a gift in proportion to the way the Lord your God has blessed you.”* Whether we give money, household goods, or even animals, the offering should come from a **heart of gratitude** for God's provision and goodness in our lives.

Similarly, when it comes to **tithing**, the tenth of our income (**Malachi 3:10**), this should be done **in love** and from the **heart**. Tithing is not a transaction but a way to express our love for God and our acknowledgment of His ownership of everything we have. **2 Corinthians 9:7** clearly states, *“Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.”*

Tithing should not be seen as a “payment” to manipulate or control the outcome of our lives, nor should it be used in any ritualistic way to "buy" blessings. Instead, it should be an **act of worship**, reflecting our love and trust in God. When we tithe, we are simply acknowledging that **everything we have belongs to God** and that we trust Him to provide for our needs.

Jesus taught in **Matthew 6:24** that we cannot serve both God and money. Our giving should never be motivated by fear or a desire for control, but by a **heart of love and devotion** to God. Money, household items, and even animals should all be treated as gifts from God, to be given back to Him as an expression of our love and gratitude, never as a means to manipulate His will.

## A Word of Love and Truth

To all who are listening, I share these thoughts not out of criticism but out of a deep desire to see us all walk in the fullness of God's truth and protection. The enemy would love nothing more than to divert us from the simple yet powerful **gospel of Jesus Christ**, which is the **power of God for salvation** (Romans 1:16).

As believers, our responsibility is to **align our hearts and lives with God’s Word**, not with rituals or practices that mimic those of the world. Let us always seek a deeper relationship with Christ and trust in His ability to break every chain, every altar, and every stronghold.

May we stay rooted in the **truth of the Gospel** and allow God’s Word to be the final authority in all matters of faith and practice.
